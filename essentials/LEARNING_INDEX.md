## 🎓 TOP 10 LEARNINGS

### 1. Trust Score is King
Stocks with trust score >50% have 80% higher success rate. Never compromise on this.

### 2. Revenue Decline = Death
Even if profit grows, revenue decline leads to -4.69% losses. Auto-reject.

### 3. Large Capex Works
₹10,000+ crore announcements from PSU/blue-chips deliver consistent 1-2% returns.

### 4. Results Day = Trading Day
Enter on results announcement, exit within 48h. Can deliver 3-4% gains.

### 5. Blacklists Save Money
RETAIL, HINDALCO, APOLLO, WEL, BEL have 0% success. Permanent ban.

### 6. Event Types Matter
Order/Contract (62.6% trust) > M&A/JV (56.7%) > Results (53.5%) > General (35%).

### 7. Ticker Verification Critical
70% error rate in mapping. Always verify on NSE before trading.

### 8. Deal Size Sweet Spot
₹100-500 crore deals deliver best returns (2-3%) for mid-caps.

### 9. Brand Endorsements Work
Celebrity/ambassador news in small-cap fintech creates 2-3% pops.

### 10. Position Size Discipline
Never exceed 10% in single news-driven trade. Protect capital.
