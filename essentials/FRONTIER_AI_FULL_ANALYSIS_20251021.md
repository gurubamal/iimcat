## 💡 TRADING STRATEGY

### Entry Timing
```
DO NOT enter at market open! Follow this sequence:

1. Pre-Market (9:00-9:15 AM):
   - Check for overnight news
   - Monitor pre-open price action
   - Set price alerts

2. First Hour (9:15-10:15 AM):
   - Wait for initial volatility to settle
   - Look for pullback to 20-SMA
   - Confirm RVOL still > 1.2x

3. Entry Signal:
   - Reversal candle off 20-SMA
   - Volume spike on reversal
   - Set stop immediately at entry

4. Position Sizing:
   Risk = 2% of capital
   Shares = Risk / (Entry - Stop)
```

### Exit Strategy
```
Stage 1: TP1 Hit (+5-6%)
   → Sell 50% position
   → Move stop to breakeven
   → Lock in profits

Stage 2: TP2 Hit (+10-12%)
   → Sell 25% position
   → Trail stop with 2.5×ATR
   → Let winners run

Stage 3: Trail Stop
   → Hold 25% with trailing stop
   → Exit on stop hit or major reversal
```

### Stop Loss Discipline
```
ABSOLUTE RULES:
1. Set stop immediately after entry
2. Never move stop against you
3. Exit if stop hit - NO EXCEPTIONS
4. Max 2 losses in a row = STOP TRADING
5. Review what went wrong before next trade
