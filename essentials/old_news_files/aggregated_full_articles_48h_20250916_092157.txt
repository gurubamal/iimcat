--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mukesh Ambani, who announced the launch of the initial public offer (IPO) of Reliance Industries’ telecom arm Reliance Jio next year, is also parallelly working on a listing of Reliance Retail, with a potential valuation of close to $200 billion, sources with knowledge of developments said.
The process of tightening and streamlining Reliance Retail, the country’s largest retailer, has already started with the demerger of the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) business, Reliance Consumer Products, that will now be a direct subsidiary of Reliance Industries.
Sources indicated that the FMCG demerger and the rationalisation of Reliance Retail’s store network, by closing down under-performing stores, is being done to boost the margins of Reliance Retail, the target being to fetch it a good valuation, so that it can go to the market.
While it is early days as yet, indications are that an imminent public listing can be expected in 2027, a year after the listing of Reliance Jio.
The listing will give exit opportunities to its investors such as Singapore’s GIC, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Qatar Investment Authority, KKR, TPG, Silver Lake and others.
After the carve out of Reliance Consumer, Reliance Retail will be left with formats such as Reliance Smart, Freshpik, Reliance Digital, JioMart, Reliance Trends, 7-Eleven, Reliance Trends, Reliance Jewels and others.
The demerger of Reliance Consumer is expected to be completed by this month-end, with all regulatory approvals coming through.
Consolidation talks
Sources said that there may even be a consolidation of the formats, though the talks are still preliminary.
RIL did not respond to an email request for comments on its future plans.
Over the past several quarters, Reliance Retail has been rationalising its store network by closing down under-performing outlets. The aim is to take it to a double-digit operating margin.
In FY25, Reliance Retail reported operating profit of $2.9 billion on revenue of $38.7 billion. Its EBITDA margin in FY25 was at 8.6 per cent, which improved marginally to 8.7 per cent in the June quarter.

Title   : Anil Ambani group stocks Reliance Power, Reliance Infra rally 5%. Here’s what’s unfolding

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The gains come after both stocks shed nearly 30% over the past three months, erasing much of the optimism that greeted Ambani’s corporate comeback earlier this year. Over the past year, Reliance Power has remained higher by 52% and Reliance Infra by 20%, but that is a sharp comedown from May peaks, when the two had rallied 173% and 141% respectively over 12 months.
Technical signals mixed
From a technical standpoint, Reliance Infra remains under pressure. The stock trades below seven of its eight key simple moving averages, including the 10-day and 200-day, with its Relative Strength Index at 34, just above oversold levels. Its Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) stands at -14, a strong bearish signal.
Reliance Power’s chart looks somewhat firmer, trading above five of its eight SMAs, including the 200-day, though its RSI at 42.9 and MACD at -1.3 also reflect bearish undertones.
Legal shadows deepen
The bounce came despite mounting legal risks for Ambani. The Enforcement Directorate has filed a fresh case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act against him, Reliance Communications and others, alleging they defrauded the State Bank of India of more than Rs 2,900 crore. The case stems from a Central Bureau of Investigation complaint in August that triggered raids at Ambani’s residence and Reliance Communications’ offices.
Ambani has “strongly denied all allegations and charges,” saying he has been “selectively singled out” over matters dating back more than a decade, when he served as a non-executive director at Reliance Communications. Adding to the cloud, Bank of Baroda this month classified Reliance Communications’ loans as “fraud,” following similar moves by SBI and Bank of India.
Earnings offer little relief
Both companies returned to profitability in the June quarter. Reliance Power reported a Rs 44.68 crore profit, reversing a Rs 97.85 crore loss a year earlier, though revenue declined 5.3% to Rs 1,885.58 crore. Reliance Infra earned Rs 59.84 crore versus a Rs 233.74 crore loss last year, but sales slid nearly 18% to Rs 5,907.82 crore.
“Reliance Infrastructure has corrected sharply but showed signs of repair in Q1 FY26,” said Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS, pointing to tighter costs and arbitration progress. “While unrelated to R-Infra’s operations, this headline risk can weigh on multiples.”
Recent wins in energy
Reliance Power last week announced it had secured a 500 MW/1000 MWh Battery Energy Storage System contract from the Solar Energy Corporation of India, marking its entry into renewable storage. The project, to be delivered at SECI’s Fatehgarh substation in Rajasthan, is slated for commissioning within 24 months.
Separately, Reliance Infra in mid-August bagged a 390 MW solar power plus 780 MWh battery storage project from NHPC, underscoring its tilt toward clean energy.
Outlook
Dasani said Reliance Infra’s performance over the next two quarters hinges on execution in EPC projects, arbitration cash inflows and cost controls. Reliance Power’s trajectory, he added, depends on stable operations at its Sasan and Rosa plants and timely discom payments.
Still, analysts caution that any operational progress could be eclipsed by investigations linked to Ambani. For investors, the question remains whether the fragile rebound can withstand intensifying legal scrutiny, or whether it marks another fleeting uptick in the long-stalled turnaround of Ambani’s debt-laden empire.

Title   : Aiming for market leadership in mid-size SUV segment: Maruti Suzuki official

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maruti Suzuki India is gunning for leadership in the mid-size SUV segment in the domestic market, currently dominated by its South Korean rival Hyundai, a senior company official said on Monday.
The company, which has launched its new mid-size SUV Victoris with introductory prices ranging from ₹10.5 lakh to ₹19.99 lakh (ex-showroom), is targeting a wider reach, specially GenZ customers by bringing it through its ARENA retail chain, Maruti Suzuki India Senior Executive Officer, Marketing & Sales Partho Banerjee told reporters here in an interaction.
"There are three segments (in SUVs). There is entry, mid and the premium. In the entry segment, we are the market leaders. In mid-SUV, we are not the market leaders. Our aspiration is to become the market leader there, and in premium SUV right now, we don't operate," he said when asked about the company's aspirations in the SUV segment.
He said the mid-size SUV segment is "the only segment" where Maruti Suzuki India, the country's largest carmaker, is not the leader.
"That is our endeavor. We want to be the market leader (in mid size SUV segment)," Banerjee said while declining to put a timeline to achieve the target.
As per industry estimates, the mid-size SUV segment clocked total sales of around 10 lakh units in FY25. Hyundai Motor India's Creta is the leader in the segment and it clocked overall sales of 1,94,871 units in FY25.
So far, Maruti Suzuki India has been present in the segment with only Grand Vitara, which is retailed through its premium chain NEXA. It clocked sales of 1.23 lakh units in FY25.
With the Victoris coming in, Banerjee said the company is optimistic of enhancing its presence in the mid-size SUV segment.
"We are getting bookings of almost 1,000 per day since it was opened...So far, we have received almost 10,000 bookings," he added.
Sales of the Victoris will commence from September 22, 2025, the company said.
By bringing the Victoris in the ARENA mass market retail chain which has over 4,000 outlets across the country as compared to 700 of NEXA premium outlets, the company is aiming for a wider reach, with the focus on GenZ.
"We are looking forward to having a niche segment, typically targeting the Gen Z customers, which is a huge segment. We want to cater to that," Banerjee added.
The Victoris comes in 21 variants, including strong hybrid, four-wheel drive, CNG and smart hybrid, with 5-star safety ratings making it aspirational, yet accessible for today's youthful SUV customers, he added.
