Account aggregators (AAs) have enabled ₹1.6 lakh crore of loan disbursements in 2025 alone, according to a statement by Sahamati, an industry body of AAs.
AAs went live four years ago and currently have over 780 financial institutions including banks, NBFCs, insurers, mutual funds, pension funds, stockbrokers and wealth managers on their platform. Over 2.12 billion accounts have agreed for consent-driven data sharing, while 269 million customer consents have been fulfilled over the last four years. There are 16 AAs currently operational in India.
Four to five crore customers are estimated to have availed a financial service – loan, insurance, PFM, portfolio management – using the AA Framework, and loan approval timelines have been cut from weeks tounder 48 hours for many MSMEs, said the statement.
BG Mahesh, CEO, Sahamati, said, “Four years ago, the account aggregator framework was just taking its first steps. Today, it is emerging as a cornerstone of India’s digital public infrastructure, enabling millions to access credit and financial services with consent, trust, and transparency. This anniversary is both a celebration and a reminder of the vast opportunities ahead.”
Going ahead, stakeholders must expand use cases beyond credit, deepen adoption across sectors, and strengthen global leadership in open finance, the industry body said.
