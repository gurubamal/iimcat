Venture capital firm Peak XV Partners has seen another senior-level departure with managing director Harshjit Sethi stepping down.
Sethi, who spearheaded the firm’s artificial intelligence (AI) bets and sat on the boards of companies such as Sarvam, resigned earlier this week. His portfolio also includes fintech player BharatPe, which was mired in a high-profile dispute with cofounder Ashneer Grover before a settlement was reached last September.
Sethi started his career at the firm in fintech, backing start-ups such as Turtlemint, Brightmoney and Smallcase, before expanding into enterprise software and AI. He later led investments in companies including Darwinbox, Enterpret and RapidCanvas.
His exit comes at a critical moment for Peak XV, which is raising its first independent fund following its split from Sequoia Capital last year. In June, the firm strengthened its AI focus by bringing on board Arnav Sahu, previously a principal at Y Combinator, to join its newly formed San Francisco-based AI team.
Responding to businessline queries, a Peak XV spokesperson said: “Harshjit will be transitioning from his role at Peak XV in the coming months to pursue his next chapter. We are deeply grateful for his contributions and remain focused on serving our LPs and founders.”
Sethi’s departure adds to a string of senior exits at the venture capital firm over the past year. In June, managing directors Shailesh Lakhani and Abheek Anand left the firm, while in April 2024, Piyush Gupta quit to launch a secondaries-focused fund. Other senior leaders who have moved on include chief marketing officer Gayatri Yadav (now at Reliance Industries), chief public policy officer Shweta Rajpal Kohli, Surge partner Anandamoy Roychowdhary, principal Shraeyansh Thakur, and most recently, chief product officer Anuj Sahai, who stepped down in August.
The series of departures comes as Peak XV navigates a more competitive investment environment and sharpens its sectoral focus, particularly in AI and enterprise software, areas where Sethi played a key role.

Short-form learning platform Seekho has raised $28 million in Series B funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners, with participation from Goodwater Capital and existing investors Lightspeed Venture Partners and Elevation Capital.
The funds will be used to build new experiences through new content formats and to leverage AI-first solutions.
Founded in 2020 by Rohit Choudhary, Keertay Agarwal and Yash Banwani, Seekho provides bite-sized, curated, vernacular learning content for Bharat. This content, delivered in 3-5 minute videos, focuses on practical knowledge for career and self-growth for example guidance on availing digital services, growing an Instagram/YouTube presence, improving business operations, language learning, and many more.
Rohit Choudhary, Founder, said: “At Seekho, our mission is to make learning fun and easy for everyone regardless of language, location or background. We believe learning should be relevant, bite-sized, and accessible in the palm of your hand. With Bessemer joining us on this journey, we’re excited to build a category-defining product that puts ‘Edutainment on Tap’ for the next 500 million Indians. This funding will accelerate our vision of making learning as seamless as scrolling a feed - but with impact that lasts a lifetime.”
Seekho currently has 25 million monthly active users, demonstrating a 60 per cent quarter-over-quarter growth, said the company in a statement. The platform targets tier-II cities and beyond, delivering content through short, episodic videos lasting two to five minutes.
Anant Vidur Puri, Partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, said: “The trifecta of 800 million+ smartphone users in India, each of them spending 7-8 hours a day, and frictionless online payments means that almost all aspects of life have moved to digital platforms - from buying groceries to financial transactions and now, with Seekho, education as well.”
