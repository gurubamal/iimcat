Integrated electronics manufacturing company Kaynes Technology says it is witnessing only a limited impact from the recent US tariffs. According to Ramesh Kannan, Founder and MD, while existing customers are not looking to shift out of India, newer customers have adopted a ‘wait-and-watch’ approach, slowing down fresh engagements.
“There will be an impact in the short term, but over the long run, things will settle. I’m not expecting a major jump immediately, but more US customers are thinking of coming to India. Those plans have not stopped, they’re only moving a little slower,” Kannan told businessline.
Currently, exports contribute 23 per cent of Kaynes’ revenue, with the US accounting for nearly 13 per cent. Kannan acknowledged that the additional tariffs have created uncertainty and temporarily slowed decision-making. “In the long term, they have no choice. They will come to India, and they believe strongly in that shift,” he said.
The company is seeing strong traction outside the US. “A lot of developmental activity is happening, especially from Europe. We are also seeing healthy demand in the market, with many RFQs (requests for quotation) coming in, some already materialised, and others in the pipeline,” he added.
Kaynes reported an annual revenue of ₹2,721.8 crore in FY24-25, up from ₹368.2 crore in FY19-20, according to its annual report. Its current order book for the year stands at ₹6,596.9 crore.
