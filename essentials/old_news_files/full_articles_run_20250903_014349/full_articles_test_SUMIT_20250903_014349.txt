Biofuel producer TruAlt Bioenergy Limited (TBL) and Sumitomo Corporation have formally announced an ongoing discussion of a strategic bioenergy partnership during the Japan–India Next-Generation Economic Forum, held recently in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Prime Minister of Japan Shigeru Ishiba.
The agreement will mark a new milestone in the India–Japan partnership, uniting India’s ambition to achieve energy sovereignty and emerge as a global hub for biofuels with Japan’s expertise in advanced decarbonization technologies under the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM). It reflects the shared resolve of both nations to accelerate the goals of the Paris Agreement, enhance energy security and foster sustainable, inclusive economic growth.
The collaboration lays out a clear roadmap for investments, beginning with the development of four Compressed Biogas (CBG) plants in Karnataka and Maharashtra. These projects are expected to create around 700 direct and indirect jobs and unlock an additional 800 to 1,000 livelihood opportunities, TruAlt said in a statement.
The partnership will expand into future projects in the ethanol and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) sectors that are critical to India’s clean energy transition and the global decarbonization agenda.
To implement this vision, a Joint Venture Company (JVC) will be established, with TruAlt Bioenergy holding 51% and Sumitomo Corporation 49%, the statement said. The initiative is designed to enhance farmer incomes, drive rural industrialisation, and strengthen India’s energy self-reliance, while laying the groundwork for scaled investments in ethanol and SAF in the years ahead.
Vijay Nirani, Founder & Managing Director of TruAlt Bioenergy, said, “Biofuels lie at the heart of India’s quest for energy sovereignty and are integral to our Panchamrit commitments of lowering carbon intensity and expanding renewables. This partnership with Sumitomo Corporation represents the convergence of their global expertise in sustainable enterprise and TruAlt Bioenergy’s leadership in India’s biofuels sector. Anchored in the Joint Crediting Mechanism, it is designed not only to accelerate India’s clean energy transition but also to contribute meaningfully to Japan’s climate commitments. Together, we are laying the foundation for India to emerge as a global hub for biofuels while empowering farmers, strengthening rural economies and building a resilient, green future for generations to come.”
