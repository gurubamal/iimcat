On a year-on-year basis, the company's revenue and Ebitda grew 21% and 3.7% to ₹379.2 crore and ₹241 crore, respectively in the June quarter. Net loss reduced to ₹4.2 crore in the first quarter of FY25 from net loss of ₹23 crore in the year-ago quarter. Normalised Ebitda margins during the quarter improved to 16% vs 9.3% in the previous year.
"Our margin continues to remain consistent and will expand from now becuase there is going to be more capacity maturing in the second half of the current fiscal year," Harsh Binani, executive director of Smartworks, told ET.
The company stated that its revenue grew more than 40% annually in the past five years. It is expected to grow by 30% in FY26.
For the company, around 8.3 million square feet of space is already operational. An extra 0.7 million square feet is under fit-out and other 1.1 million sq ft, signed in the last six months, will get handed over in the next two quarters. Further, there are 1.9 million square feet of signed LOIs and term sheets, which will be commissioned by the end of this financial year or next year. All this adds up to a total capacity of up to 12 million square feet by the end of FY26. This will translate to 275,000 seats from 190,000 seats.
After this, within the first 12 months, it aims to reach 65-70% occupancy and achieve breakeven. The management stated that it can recover the entire payback with a steady-state ramp-up of occupancy in about 30 to 32 months.
Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue declined to 27.3% compared with 32% in the year-ago quarter. The company said that this could reduce further because of its model of taking up large campuses, and since its clients are typically sticky, it turns into long tenures.
