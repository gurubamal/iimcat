Biofuel producer TruAlt Bioenergy Limited (TBL) and Sumitomo Corporation have formally announced an ongoing discussion of a strategic bioenergy partnership during the Japan–India Next-Generation Economic Forum, held recently in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Prime Minister of Japan Shigeru Ishiba.
The agreement will mark a new milestone in the India–Japan partnership, uniting India’s ambition to achieve energy sovereignty and emerge as a global hub for biofuels with Japan’s expertise in advanced decarbonization technologies under the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM). It reflects the shared resolve of both nations to accelerate the goals of the Paris Agreement, enhance energy security and foster sustainable, inclusive economic growth.
The collaboration lays out a clear roadmap for investments, beginning with the development of four Compressed Biogas (CBG) plants in Karnataka and Maharashtra. These projects are expected to create around 700 direct and indirect jobs and unlock an additional 800 to 1,000 livelihood opportunities, TruAlt said in a statement.
The partnership will expand into future projects in the ethanol and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) sectors that are critical to India’s clean energy transition and the global decarbonization agenda.
To implement this vision, a Joint Venture Company (JVC) will be established, with TruAlt Bioenergy holding 51% and Sumitomo Corporation 49%, the statement said. The initiative is designed to enhance farmer incomes, drive rural industrialisation, and strengthen India’s energy self-reliance, while laying the groundwork for scaled investments in ethanol and SAF in the years ahead.
Vijay Nirani, Founder & Managing Director of TruAlt Bioenergy, said, “Biofuels lie at the heart of India’s quest for energy sovereignty and are integral to our Panchamrit commitments of lowering carbon intensity and expanding renewables. This partnership with Sumitomo Corporation represents the convergence of their global expertise in sustainable enterprise and TruAlt Bioenergy’s leadership in India’s biofuels sector. Anchored in the Joint Crediting Mechanism, it is designed not only to accelerate India’s clean energy transition but also to contribute meaningfully to Japan’s climate commitments. Together, we are laying the foundation for India to emerge as a global hub for biofuels while empowering farmers, strengthening rural economies and building a resilient, green future for generations to come.”

The appeals court ruling rattled investors after the long Labor Day holiday weekend, with September traditionally a weak month for equities. The Cboe Volatility Index - Wall Street's fear gauge - rose, but the major stock indexes ended off their worst levels of the day.
With the ruling, "the question becomes, 'Has the Trump administration alienated our trading partners as well as given up the revenue from tariffs?' That's what's plaguing markets," said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president and adviser for Wealthspire Advisors in Westport, Connecticut.
"By the same token, it's too early to call this the beginning of a great correction," he said. "At the end of the day, we all know that August-September tend to be more volatile and a little more challenging for investors before we get into the fourth quarter, which tends to be a pretty solid one." Data going back decades shows that, on average, September is the worst month for U.S. stocks, and some investors are bracing for another bumpy ride this year. In addition, investors are anxious to see the monthly U.S. payrolls report, due on Friday, and whether weak U.S. job growth continued for a fourth month in August.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 249.07 points, or 0.55%, to 45,295.81, the S&P 500 fell 44.72 points, or 0.69%, to 6,415.54 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 175.92 points, or 0.82%, to 21,279.63.
U.S. rate futures widely expect the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates this month, pricing in a 92% chance of a 25-basis-point cut at the end of its two-day policy meeting on September 17, according to CME Group's FedWatch. Real estate fell 1.7% and had among the biggest S&P 500 sector declines on the day, with U.S. 30-year Treasury yields on Tuesday climbing to their highest levels since mid-July. Also, shares of Kraft Heinz dropped 7% after the company said it will split into two companies, one focused on groceries and the other on sauces and spreads. On the flip side, shares of PepsiCo gained 1.1% after Elliott Management disclosed a $4 billion stake in the beverages company, launching an activist campaign.
On the Nasdaq, 1,555 stocks rose and 3,099 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by about a 1.99-to-1 ratio There were 105 new highs and 118 new lows.
On the NYSE declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by a 2.4-to-1 ratio . There were 176 new highs and 53 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 16.41 billion shares, compared with the 16.26 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
