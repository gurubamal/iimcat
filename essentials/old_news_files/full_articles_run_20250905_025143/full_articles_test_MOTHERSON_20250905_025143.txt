Indian headline indices conceded their morning gains on a volatile Thursday, dragged mainly by IT and energy stocks. Most auto stocks also shed their morning gains to close lower. The daily close was just below the 21 EMA, indicating a continuation of weakness, although the index appears to be nearing a potential trend reversal. Commenting on the day’s action, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said that Nifty pared most of its gains after a gap-up start driven by optimism over GST reforms. “A decisive move above 24,750 could provide the strength needed for the Nifty to move towards 25,000. A sustained move above 25,000 could trigger a further rally. On the other hand, failure to close above 24,750 within the next two to three days may lead to renewed selling pressure on the index," De said. Here are 4 stock recommendations for Friday:

Buy Netweb Technologies at Rs 2652.10 | Upside:17 %
Target: Rs 3,110
Stop Loss: Rs 2,426 Netweb Technologies India is exhibiting a strong bullish trend and the stock has recently broken out of a key swing high while forming a rounding bottom pattern, signalling a reversal from a crucial support zone. A decisive close above the Rs 2,600 resistance level, supported by a surge in trading volumes, indicates strong investor participation and validates the breakout. Sustaining above Rs 2,750 could further strengthen the uptrend, while Rs 2500 is expected to act as support in case of minor retracements.

Buy Motherson Sumi Wiring at Rs 44.15 | Upside: 16%
Target: Rs 51.06 Stop Loss: Rs 40.65 MSUMI is currently showing a strong confluence of bullish signals. The stock has recovered by forming a higher-high and higher-low structure, reflecting sustained upward momentum. It is also on the verge of a cup-and-handle formation, indicating a technically robust base and growing accumulation. A decisive close above Rs 45 could act as a catalyst for the next leg of the rally. Traders can apply a positional stop-loss at Rs 40.65. Upon confirmation of the breakout above Rs 45, the stock could aim for Rs 51.06 and beyond, offering a favourable risk-reward setup for positional trades.

Buy Coal India at Rs 391.45 | Upside: 11%
Target: Rs 436
Stop Loss: Rs 369 Coal India is displaying a strong bullish trend on the daily chart and it has broken out of a falling trendline, indicating a potential trend reversal and the start of an upward move. This breakout is accompanied by rising volumes, highlighting strong buying interest and validating the bullish sentiment. A decisive breakout above the Rs 400 resistance level could trigger a sharp rally toward the short-term target of Rs 436.
On the downside, immediate support lies at Rs 378, while a stop-loss at Rs 369 is advised to limit risk.
