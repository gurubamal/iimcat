Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer David Solomon signaled there’s no need for the Federal Reserve to rapidly cut interest rates, diverging from the Trump administration’s pressure on the central bank to loosen monetary policy.
“It just doesn’t feel to me like the policy rate is extraordinarily restrictive when you look at risk appetite,” Solomon said at a Barclays Plc financial-services conference. Investor enthusiasm in markets currently is at the exuberant end of the spectrum, he said.
Federal Reserve policymakers are widely expected to lower rates by a quarter point at their meeting next week, according to pricing in futures contracts. Expectations have also been climbing for further reductions in meetings through the end of the year. If the Fed follows through on the cut at its Sept. 17 meeting, that “could turn into a ‘Sell the News’ event as investors pull back,” according to a note from JPMorgan Chase & Co.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last month that the Fed needs to execute a cycle of interest-rate cuts, suggesting the central bank’s benchmark ought to be at least 1.5 percentage points lower than it is now.
Solomon’s former colleague and Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Beth Hammack reiterated that she doesn’t see the case for lowering interest rates this month, with current data showing inflation is still running above the central bank’s 2% target and headed higher.
Goldman has been fending off biting reaction from the Trump administration recently. Last month, President Donald Trump admonished the bank’s research work on his tariff measures, criticized Solomon for failing to publicly applaud his government’s achievements and even mocked the CEO, saying on social media that Solomon “ought to just focus on being a DJ, and not bother running a major Financial Institution.”
On Sunday, Bessent ramped up criticism of the New York-based firm, dismissing its research on the effect of tariffs on US consumers and businesses. “I made a good career of trading against Goldman Sachs,” he said on NBC’s Meet the Press.
Solomon said he see a mostly constructive environment but warned that “trade policy has been a headwind to growth,” adding that “uncertainty has slowed investment.”
He said that there are a “handful of constructive forces against some headwind, some uncertainty.”
Goldman’s shares have climbed 30% this year, trailing only Citigroup Inc.’s performance among the big US banks. On Monday, the stock closed at $741.85, just shy of a record of $751.22 reached in August.

Title   : Epstein Letter Allegedly From Trump Released by House Democrats

House Democrats on Monday released an alleged birthday note that they said Donald Trump sent to Jeffrey Epstein, raising pressure on the president over questions about his past interactions with the late disgraced financier.
The release stems from the trove of documents received by the House Oversight Committee, including a birthday book compiled for Epstein’s 50th birthday. The papers, which haven’t been made public, also include Epstein’s last will and testament, entries from his address and contact books from 1990 to 2019, and information about his known bank accounts, an aide to the House Oversight Committee said Monday. The committee is investigating the sex-trafficking operation run by Epstein.
Democratic committee members posted the alleged image of Trump’s birthday message. The Wall Street Journal in July reported on the existence of an entry by Trump in the book.
“HERE IT IS: We got Trump’s birthday note to Jeffrey Epstein that the President said doesn’t exist. Trump talks about a “wonderful secret” the two of them shared. What is he hiding? Release the files!” the X post read.
Trump has denied composing the message to Epstein and White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich on Monday said the image is fabricated.
“Time for @newscorp to open that checkbook, it’s not his signature. DEFAMATION!” Budowich said on X.
Trump has sued the Journal’s reporters, the paper’s publisher Dow Jones & Co., parent company News Corp. and its founder Rupert Murdoch, accusing them of libel and saying the letter did not exist.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt in a post on X said that Trump “will continue to aggressively pursue litigation” and that “this is fake news to perpetuate the Democrat Epstein Hoax!”
Dow Jones did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.
“We have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit,” a Dow Jones spokesperson said in response to the lawsuit when it was filed.
The birthday book was compiled by Epstein’s former accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in helping Epstein sexually abuse underage women. Epstein died in jail, awaiting trial, in what US authorities have repeatedly said was a suicide.
Committee staff would review the new documents and make them public in the near future, the aide said.
