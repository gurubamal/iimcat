Drugmaker Glenmark Pharmaceuticals’ wholly-owned subsidiary Ichnos Glenmark Innovation (IGI) has received an upfront payment of $700 million (about ₹6,000 crore) from US drugmaker AbbVie.
“The payment is in accordance with the agreed contractual terms and is being made towards an exclusive global licensing agreement for IGI’s lead investigational asset, ISB 2001, across North America, Europe, Japan, and Greater China markets,” Glenmark told the stock exchanges. The company’s shares were up over 2 per cent on the BSE, at ₹2,100.60, at 11.28 am, on Tuesday.
Clinical trials
The Mumbai-based drugmaker had in July announced this deal on its drug candidate that was in early Phase-I clinical trials and had shown promising outcomes in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.
While the drug candidate still has someway to go in terms of trials and regulatory clearances before it hits the market — the deal itself had set a benchmark for drugmakers from India in terms of innovation and the quality of data, industry-insiders had said when the transaction was announced.
Glenmark’s Managing Director Glenn Saldanha had then said, that a deal of this magnitude should bring more attention to innovation in India.
The drug candidate ISB 2001 was developed using New York-based IGI’s proprietary BEAT protein platform, for oncology and autoimmune diseases, the company had then said. All future developments were to be undertaken by AbbVie, company officials had then said, adding that IGI could receive up to $1.225 billion in development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, along with tiered, double-digit royalties on net sales.
While AbbVie has the rights to manufacture and commercialise ISB 2001 in most developed markets including the US, Europe, Canada, China and Japan, IGI will give Glenmark Pharma rights to commercialise in India and all emerging markets, company management had then said.
