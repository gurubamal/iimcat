--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Bloomberg) -- A spate of billion-dollar deals for Indian banks has thrust the country’s financial sector into the global spotlight, at a time when US credit losses and trade tensions have rattled investors globally.
Over the weekend, Emirates NBD Bank PJSC said it plans to invest $3 billion in RBL Bank Ltd., marking the biggest foreign investment in India’s banking sector. Earlier this month, Abu Dhabi’s International Holding Co. PJSC inked a deal to buy into Sammaan Capital Ltd. for about $1 billion, while Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc.’s banking unit in May agreed to pay $1.6 billion for 20% of Yes Bank Ltd.
All told, about $15 billion of deals involving financial services targets in India have been struck this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show, as global investors scour for opportunities in one of the world’s fastest-growing major economies. This builds on the momentum of prior years to invest in lenders, insurance and fintech players.
The exuberance to what’s happening elsewhere is striking. Recent US collapses of Tricolor Holdings and First Brands Group have stoked fears of hidden credit losses. India itself is trying to work things out with the US after it was slapped with 50% tariffs that could hit its growth.
There also isn’t a track record of triumph by overseas buyers, as the sector remains dominated by well-entrenched local players and had struggled with a shadow bank crisis less than a decade ago.
“The success story of foreign banks acquiring Indian banks is very limited” and hasn’t always reflected in profit and revenue growth, said Hemindra Hazari, an independent research analyst. The large sums foreign investors are willing to invest shows intent, but whether they can build a profitable retail franchise in India’s competitive market remains to be seen, he said.
For now, suitors are focusing on the positives. Indian lenders look relatively more insulated, and are gaining from rapid digital adoption, government moves, as well as a large under-banked population. Japan’s megabanks have been outspoken about their appetite for Indian assets, while deep-pocketed firms from the Middle East and Europe are now setting their sights on the expanding middle class in Asia’s third-largest economy.
“The Indian growth story has been accepted globally,” RBL’s Chief Executive Officer R Subramaniakumar said at a briefing on Sunday. He pointed out that a stable financial system and robust regulators add to the appeal.
The Reserve Bank of India has moved in recent years to strengthen the financial sector via measures aimed at boosting credit flow, encouraging lending and financing. The regulator has also clamped down on excessive risk-taking, frequently warning shadow lenders about pursuing growth at any cost and vowing to take action if they don’t strengthen risk controls.
The steps come after the sector blew up about seven years ago when a pile-up of bad loans weighed on growth. This led the government to overhaul bankruptcy laws and re-capitalize state-owned banks.
Now, policymakers are exploring ways to attract more foreign investment, including discussing options to make it easier for overseas investors to raise stakes in state-run banks and allowing large companies to apply for banking licenses, Bloomberg News reported earlier.
Recent set of earnings from industry heavyweights HDFC Bank Ltd. and ICICI Bank Ltd. saw both lenders reporting better-than-expected results driven by lending growth, even as interest margins remain under pressure. The 12-member Nifty Bank Index has rallied more than 13% this year, closing at a record high on Friday.
More jumbo deals could follow. A planned government stake sale in IDBI Bank Ltd. is expected to fetch billions. Japan’s biggest lender Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. is actively hunting acquisition targets, and is said to be in advanced talks to buy a stake in Shriram Finance Ltd.
“Geopolitical risks have accelerated financial and supply chain risks, and foreign investors are looking for alphas in countries that minimize them,” said Vivek Ramji Iyer, partner and leader in financial services practices at Grant Thornton Bharat. “India’s domestic focus and low correlation with the global economy make it a lucrative entry point.”

Title   : Bill to amend Companies Act likely in Winter Session

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The government may move a bill to amend Companies Act 2013 during the winter session of Parliament. One such amendment aims to provide an ‘enabling environment’ for desi firms to compete with the big four audit, accounts and advisory firms.
Sections 139- 146 of the Companies Act deal with issues related to auditors in a company. Section 139 is related to appointment of auditors. Section 140 deals with removal, resignation of auditor and giving special notice. Section 141 prescribes eligibility, qualifications and disqualifications of auditors. Section 142 talks about remuneration, section 143 prescribes powers and duties, section 144 prohibits services not to be rendered, section 145 is about signing audit reports and section 146 assigns auditors to attend general meeting.
Among these, amendments in sections 141 and 144 are critical. The changes, under discussion, aim to ensure that regulatory norms align with evolving business models in the audit and advisory sector.
Promoting MDP firms
According to officials, consultations are going on to promote Indian Multi-Disciplinary Partnership (MDP) firms. A group of top officials from Finance, Corporate Affairs and Economic Advisory Council has met twice under the chairmanship of the Principal Secretary-2 to the Prime Minister, Shaktikanta Das. Last month, the Corporate Affairs Ministry invited suggestions on the establishment of Indian MDP firms. An office memorandum by the Ministry identified six key issues that need to be addressed to help Indian firms grow to an international level.
These include advertising and marketing bans, restrictions on MDPs, fragmented licencing, public procurement and empanellment processes, standalone operations and the absence of global collaboration platforms. The global consulting and auditing industry is valued at nearly $240 billion, dominated by international networks and global strategy majors. According to MCA, despite India’s world-class talent pool, domestic firms remain marginal players, particularly in high-value audits and consulting, partly due to structural and regulatory barriers.
Meanwhile, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in India (ICAI) has been engaged to align regulatory frameworks with global practices. In a presentation before media, the institute said while global accounting firms are backed by institutional capital, global partnerships and diversified funding enabling large-scale investments and growth, Indian CA firms are primarily partner-funded and have limited avenues for capital infusion.
At the same time, global accounting firms have advantage of strong, unified global brand with coordinated outreach, visibility and reputational equity across jurisdictions, Indian CA firms have limited global visibility; absence of institutional branding for Indian firms, ICAI said.
