--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meanwhile, the revenue from operations could grow between 2.3% to 3.7% on a quarter-on-quarter basis while rising 2.6%-4% on a YoY basis. The topline range is seen at Rs 13,661 crore to Rs 13,846 crore.
The estimates of Nomura, Nuvama Institutional Equities, Axis Securities and HDFC Securities are taken into account.
The highest PAT estimate is given by Nomura while HDFC Securities remains most modest in the pack even as it estimates a YoY decline in Tech Mahindra’s net profit. Meanwhile, the Japanese brokerage remains most conservative in its revenue estimates while Axis is most bullish.
Tech Mahindra will announce its July-September quarter earnings on Tuesday after market hours. Here’s what brokerages expect from the company:
5 key things to watch out:
1. PAT
Brokerages foresee a solid recovery in profitability sequentially, led by margin expansion and higher deal conversions.
– Nomura expects net profit at Rs 1,363 crore, up 9% YoY and 19.5% QoQ
– Nuvama estimates PAT at Rs 1,338 crore, rising 7.1% YoY and 17.3% QoQ, supported by improved operational performance.
– Axis Securities projects profit at Rs 1,279 crore, an increase of 1.7% YoY and 13.4% QoQ
– HDFC Securities, however, pegs PAT lower at Rs 1,270 crore, down 5.5% YoY but still up 11.4% QoQ.
Overall, consensus points to double-digit sequential growth in the bottom line after several muted quarters.
2. Revenue
Revenue growth is expected to remain modest as the company navigates a still-challenging demand environment.
– Nomura forecasts revenue at Rs 13,661 crore, up 2.3% QoQ and 2.6% YoY, led by both the communications and enterprise verticals.
– Nuvama expects revenue to rise 3.2% QoQ and 3.5% YoY to Rs 13,773 crore, while Axis Securities estimates Rs 13,846 crore, indicating 3.7% sequential growth.
– Axis Securities pegs Q2 topline at Rs 13,846 crore up 4% YoY and up 3.7% QoQ
– HDFC Securities projects a similar trajectory at Rs 13,740 crore, reflecting a 3.2% YoY growth and 2.9% QoQ rise.
The ramp-up of large deals in BFSI, retail, and communications is seen driving this steady top-line performance.
3. EBIT
Brokerages expect a strong improvement in Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT), supported by higher utilisation and productivity gains.
Nuvama pegs EBIT at Rs 1,623 crore, up 9.9% QoQ and 26.7% YoY, the most optimistic among peers.
Axis Securities expects EBIT at Rs 1,604 crore, an 8.6% QoQ and 25.3% YoY increase.
HDFC Securities projects EBIT at Rs 1,574 crore, up 22.9% YoY and 6.5% QoQ, while Nomura expects margins to expand by 40 bps sequentially.
This rebound reflects ongoing restructuring efforts and a focus on operational efficiency.
4. Margins
A broad-based recovery in margins is expected as cost controls and restructuring benefits start to reflect in Q2.
Nuvama forecasts the highest EBIT margin at 11.8%, up 70 bps QoQ and 220 bps YoY.
Axis Securities and HDFC Securities see margins at 11.6–11.5%, rising between 40–50 bps QoQ.
Nomura expects margins to improve 40 bps QoQ to 11.5%.
Most brokerages expect Tech Mahindra to maintain its FY27 EBIT margin guidance of 15%, underpinned by structural cost savings.
5. Key monitorables
Analysts will closely track management commentary on the demand trends in the BFSI and telecom verticals.
Large deal wins and visibility in the deal pipeline will be a thing closely watched by Japanese brokerage Nomura, which expects net new deal wins of $600–800 million.
Progress on cost optimisation initiatives and FY27 margin roadmap and client spending patterns amid global macro uncertainty and outlook for the enterprise business will be another top monitorable for the markets.

Title   : KEC order wins, Tata Motors demerger, and HCL Tech’s AI momentum key to watch: Pankaj Pandey

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEC International order inflows signal sector strength
Engineering major KEC International has bagged fresh orders worth nearly Rs 14,000 crore so far this financial year — about 50% of its annual guidance of Rs 28,000–30,000 crore. Pandey said this performance reflects continued momentum in the transmission and distribution (T&D) segment, which remains one of the most promising themes within the infrastructure space.“We like the entire T&D segment — both KEC International and Kalpataru Power look strong. The execution momentum is picking up, and we expect margin expansion over the next one to two years,” Pandey said.
He added that while the power generation story often takes the spotlight, power transmission and distribution will likely emerge as a key growth driver due to strong execution visibility and government capex push.
HCL Technologies shows improvement, but valuations cap upside
Commenting on the latest HCL Technologies earnings, Pandey said the numbers were broadly encouraging with signs of improvement across verticals. The company’s AI monetization, though still small at about 3% of revenue, is a step in the right direction.However, he noted that valuations are rich, limiting near-term upside.
“HCL Tech’s valuations are now similar to Infosys and TCS, which means it needs stronger earnings growth to justify further re-rating,” he said.
“TCS is already commanding a premium due to its pivot toward data centres, while HCL’s numbers need to improve more meaningfully.”
Pandey cautioned that while valuation multiples for Indian IT are near the lower end of their four-year range, the overall macro environment remains challenging, particularly given rising protectionist policies in global markets and subdued discretionary tech spending.
“Until the global AI boom cools off, we don’t expect Indian IT stocks to deliver strong price performance,” he said.
Tata Motors demerger could unlock value for investors
On Tata Motors, which officially demerged its Passenger Vehicle (PV) and Commercial Vehicle (CV) businesses this week, Pandey said the vertical split is likely to create significant value for shareholders.“We are expecting Rs 300 per share for the CV business, based on 11x FY27 EV/EBITDA multiples, in line with peers,” he said.
“The PV business could trade between ₹450–500, supported by strong growth visibility and the brand’s leadership in the electric vehicle segment.”
Pandey added that the sum-of-the-parts valuation of the two independent businesses implies overall value creation, making Tata Motors one of the more anticipated demergers in recent years.
“Both PV and CV businesses have different growth trajectories, so the split allows investors to play each theme independently,” he said.
LG Balakrishnan listing to draw investor interest
On the debut of LG Balakrishnan & Bros (LG) in the secondary market, Pandey said the listing is expected to see a positive pop, backed by a strong grey market premium.Brokerages have pegged the fair value between ₹1,750 and ₹1,800, compared to the IPO pricing of ₹1,500, which was seen as reasonable.
“The IPO was attractively priced at 37x trailing 12-month earnings, and this is the first time in a long while that a sector leader is being listed,” Pandey noted.
“The company’s strong market share across categories justifies a valuation premium, though we’ll need to see post-listing performance before assigning a definitive multiple.”
Stock-specific action to dominate ahead
Pandey expects stock-specific opportunities to dominate in the near term, with sectors like infrastructure, select auto, and utilities likely to outperform.He maintained that earnings recovery in IT, while encouraging, will take a few more quarters to translate into sustained market performance.
“While the broader market remains range-bound, focused plays in power T&D, order-heavy EPC companies, and value-unlocking stories like Tata Motors are worth tracking,” he said.

Title   : Tech Mahindra posts modest revenue growth, but margins hit new high
Source  : www.livemint.com

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tech Mahindra Ltd kicked off the second half of the fiscal year with modest sequential growth and outlined a cautious future, even as it neared the half-way mark of its three-year revival plan during which its operating margins doubled.
The Pune-based IT services company reported $1.59 billion in revenue for the July-September period, up 1.4% sequentially but down 0.2% on a yearly basis. Most of the growth came from manufacturers, which made up three-fifths of the company’s incremental revenue of $22 million. Its net profit rose 1.5% to $135 million.
The company’s management said the macroeconomic environment was stabilizing, but concerns existed.
“From a macro perspective, we see the macro as stabilizing and maybe improving in parts. But it is still fragile. There is unlikely to be any sort of V-shaped recovery in spend, but we do see a stabilization and, hopefully, growth in the second half of the year,” said Mohit Joshi, chief executive of Tech Mahindra, during the company’s post-earnings press conference on Tuesday.
Tech Mahindra shares closed 1.2% higher at ₹1,468.15 apiece on the BSE on Tuesday.
The company’s mixed signals were in contrast to two of its peers.
A day before, India's third-largest software services firm HCL Technologies Ltd’s management said that the macro environment was more or less unchanged. This was in contrast to larger peer Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, which said that there is “lingering uncertainty” in the broader economic environment.
TCS and HCL respectively ended the second quarter with $7.47 billion and $3.64 billion in revenue, up 0.6% and 2.8% sequentially.
Both the larger companies also made big-bang AI announcements. While Mumbai-based TCS announced plans to invest upwards of $6 billion over a six-year period in building and running a 1 GW data centre, Noida-based HCLTech became the first company among Indian IT’s Big Five to announce revenue from the new technology. It got $100 million in AI-led revenue last quarter.
Tech Mahindra, on the other hand, has been placing its bets on large language models.
“We are partnering to develop an indigenous, sovereign, large language model with 1 trillion parameters, the significant technical milestone that places it among the largest AI models under development globally,” said Joshi.
However, he did not reveal the investment details, and queries on project timelines went unanswered.
Instead, the management said the company was investing in talent rather than in data centres.
“The investment, from our perspective, is largely, sort of in terms of talent, rather than, you know, rather than a significant amount of data center investments, right? So, it is largely in terms of partnership and talent, that's where our investment is coming in as of now,” said Joshi, in response to Mint’s question during the press conference
The company ended the September quarter with 12.1% in operating margins, up 100 basis points from the previous quarter. Its management attributed this to “improved productivity, initiatives around fixed price projects, some volume growth, savings from selling, general and administrative expenses, amongst others. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
This jump in profitability comes as a shot in the arm for its management, which seeks to increase its operating margin to 15% by March 2027, and grow its revenue faster than peers as part of a three-year roadmap called Project Fortius, which was announced last year.
While the revenue growth has not crossed 3% in the last year, the margins have doubled from 6.1% in April last year, when it announced its margin expansion plan.
At least one analyst expressed confidence in the company’s plans.
“New deal TCV (total contract value) at $816 million was also at its highest-ever level since Q4FY22. Healthy growth coupled with continued margin expansion reinforces confidence in the company to deliver on its three-year turnaround plan outlined at the end of FY24,” said Manik Taneja, executive director for IT services at Axis Capital.
Tech Mahindra, which does not give quarterly or yearly outlook, said that tech spends for IT projects would follow.
“As far as the Indian IT industry is concerned, I do feel that the industry has a very sustainable business model, has shown resilience across economic cycles. But equally, it has had portions of hyper growth, like we saw during Covid, and periods of very slow growth, like in this period. But even in this timeframe, I feel the industry, especially Tech Mahindra, has shown its resilience,” said Joshi.
He added that “as the overall economic activity across the globe picks up, we do feel that tech spend will follow.”
For now, its results exceeded analyst expectations. According to a Bloomberg poll of 30 analysts, Tech Mahindra was expected to report $1.55 billion in revenue in the second quarter.
Another bright point was its profitability, which has been increasing for eight consecutive quarters.
The company added 4,197 people last quarter to end with 152,714 employees. HCL added more than 3,000 employees, while TCS cut its employee count by more than 19,000 people.

Title   : Tech Mahindra Q2 net profit down, revenue grows 5%

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tech Mahindra reported 4.4 per cent on-year fall in Q2 net profit owing to a one-time exceptional gain for sale of land last year, while revenue increased 5 per cent.
Its EBITDA for the quarter rose 23.8 per cent on year.
The software company reported net profit of $1,194.5 crore on revenue of $13,994 crore.
Sequentially its net profit rose 4.7 per cent sequentially with revenue increasing 4.8 per cent boosted by positive performance in the IT and BPS sectors. EBITDA rose 12 per cent on a quarterly basis to ₹ 2,168 crore.
Speaking on the quarterly results, Mohit Joshi, CEO and Managing Director, Tech Mahindra, said, “We delivered broad-based growth this quarter, reflecting the strength of our strategy and execution.”
Rohit Anand, Chief Financial Officer, Tech Mahindra, said, “This quarter marks the eighth consecutive period of margin expansion, driven by operational efficiency and disciplined execution. Our deal TCV is up 57 per cent year on year on LTM (last twelve months) basis, supported by strong deal conversions. The board has approved a dividend of ₹15 per share reflecting our continued focus on shareholder value.”
In US dollar, net profit increased 28 per cent annually and revenue was down 0.2 per cent. EBITDA margins went up 254 basis points to 12.1 per cent.
Discretionary spends
Anand said clients are looking at consolidation and cost take out projects. From a sector perspective, the company saw good growth in aerospace, consumer products and retail. In the telco sector discretionary spend has not returned in a big way.
“Most of the spend that we are seeing is either consolidation or in areas like autonomous operations that are supposed to lead to significant efficiency benefits in the future. Maybe the discretionary spend we are seeing is on the data side across industries where clients are looking to build out data stacks to get a lot more of the benefit of this AI transformation opportunity,” he said. Meanwhile, Joshi said he expects discretionary spend to come back over time.
Talking about must-have clients, the company secured 21 accounts in the first two quarters of this fiscal year. Of these, 17 have already generated over $1 million in revenue each.
Communications hit by industry stress
Communications and Technology, Media and Entertainment sectors declined in terms of performance, both sequentially and annually. However, in terms of communications, the company said yet the segment remains largely stable.
“Our largest client has stabilized its spend and delivered growth above the company average this quarter,” said Joshi, adding how the company is partnering with a key European telco client is set to launch their large telco model to bolster their service experience centre and building a data-driven ecosystem. He attributed the decline in the sector to the steep drops for all over the past two years, driven by stress faced by the telecom industry such as heavy debt load and rolling ARPU rates.
Reductions in hitech sector
In terms of hi-tech, the company expects the semiconductor space to grow for the rest of the year. In the first half of the year, Tech Mahindra was impacted by a client decision to dramatically ramp down a huge portion of their business. While citing ‘interesting new wins” in the current quarter, Tech Mahindra also stated some spending cuts and headcount reductions among some software players. Company estimated that clients are doing this for cost control reasons rather than a significant reduction in businesses.
Regarding the India AI Mission, Tech Mahindra will partner to develop an indigenous, sovereign, large language model with one trillion parameters and hyper-large LLMs and offer talent rather than data center investments.
Other verticals
BFSI grew 3.8 per cent sequentially and increased 6.2 per cent annually, acquiring a partnership with JP Morgan Payments Systems. Manufacturing grew 5.3 per cent sequentially and 5.2 per cent on a yearly basis. Largest client has stablised spend, said Joshi, attributing the performance to the demand for smart manufacturing, predictive maintenance and digital twins.
“Automotive has been broadly stable this quarter. However, we remain cautious particularly in the commercial segment which continues to face headwinds while the passenger vehicle segment shows some early signs of stabilization,” said Joshi. In terms of the logistics sector, Tech Mahindra reported strong tailwinds driven by e-commerce expansion, automation and warehousing, last-mile delivery optimization.
Q2 headcount
The company reported an IT headcount of 78,528 employees, down 2,090 year on year. The IT LTM attrition is at 12.8 per cent versus 12.6 per cent last quarter. The company officials described this as a a marginal reduction in the workforce.
H1B visa
Regarding the visa developments, Joshi said roughly only one percent of the roughly 150,000 people in the company are on H1B visa. The huge majority of the US workforce is either citizens or people on green cards.
“Our dependence on H1s is limited. Obviously, any change to this program will have an impact on us. We’re thinking is how do we make sure that we continue the work that we’ve done to build a stronger employer brand name in the US? How do we make sure that we’re able to firewall and retain our top employees in the US and other markets as we start seeing attrition, poaching? We do have a network of delivery capabilities across the world, including in the Americas, in Brazil, in Mexico, in Canada. How do we make sure we’re able to leverage,” said Joshi.
Geographically, Americas declined 2.7 per cent annually while Europe increased 5.5 per cent during the same time. Rest of the world declined 0.5 per cent. When asked, Joshi said the company estimated stabilization and growth in the second half of the year from a macro perspective.
