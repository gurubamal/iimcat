Hyundai Motor India on Sunday said it has reduced prices of its entire model range by up to ₹2.4 lakh to pass on the GST rate cut benefit to customers.
The company said the price cut ranging between ₹60,640 on Verna to ₹2.4 lakh on premium SUV Tucson will be applicable from September 22.
"This reform is not only a boost to the automotive industry but also a strong step towards empowering millions of customers by making personal mobility more affordable and accessible," Unsoo Kim, Managing Director, Hyundai Motor India, stated.
In a separate statement, Tata Motors said it will pass on the full benefit of the GST reduction on its entire commercial vehicle range to customers, effective September 22, 2025, when the revised rates come into effect.
