A delegation of the EU Parliamentary committee on international trade will be in India next week to discuss trade, economic and investment relations ahead of the year-end deadline for finalising the India-EU free trade agreement negotiations.
The seven-member team will be in India from October 27 and will be led by Cristina Maestre, the committee’s standing rapporteur for India, and Brando Benifei, the committee coordinator.
“The main objective of this visit is to contribute to increasing our mutual understanding amid intensive trade negotiations between the EU and India,” the two co-chairs said in a statement.
The mission is timely taking place just a few months ahead of the deadline to conclude negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) by the end of 2025, they added. “We look forward to discussing the issues at stake as both sides have a mutual interest in reaching a meaningful bilateral agreement and in protecting the rules-based multilateral trade order,” they said.
Negotiating teams from India and the EU met in Brussels earlier this month to sort out lingering problems in areas such as automobiles, alcoholic beverages, services and quality standards, sources said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and EU President Ursula von der Leyen set a year-end deadline for wrapping up the trade negotiations. India’s bilateral trade in goods with the European Union’s bilateral trade in goods reached €120 billion in 2024, surpassing that of China and the US, per EU figures.
The visiting European Parliament members will engage with a variety of stakeholders, to receive “first-hand information” on the opportunities and challenges posed by these trade negotiations. INTA Members are set to hold various meetings at both ministerial and parliamentary level. They will also meet the Federation of European Business in India and with the Confederation of Indian Industry. “Other meetings will be organised with civil society working on sustainability issues and with workers and employers’ representatives and organisations working on labour rights,” the EU statement said.
