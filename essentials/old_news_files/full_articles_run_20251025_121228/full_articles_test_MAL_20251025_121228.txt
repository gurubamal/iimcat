US and Chinese officials kicked off a new round of talks aimed at defusing a standoff between the world’s two largest economies before an upcoming leaders’ summit.
Chinese and US delegations began a meeting in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday morning, according the official Xinhua news agency. They’re led by Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, respectively.
Bessent and He, a longtime associate of President Xi Jinping, face the task of negotiating down new escalatory measures imposed by their countries against one another. They are also setting the stage for expected talks on Thursday between Xi and US President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders’ summit in South Korea.
Earlier in October, Trump lashed out against Beijing’s vow to broaden controls on rare-earth elements, raising the prospect of setting a sky-high tariff rate on Chinese goods and even canceling his first in-person meeting with Xi since he returned to the White House this year.
At stake is a trade truce that’s set to run out on November 10 unless extended. Months of tentative stability in the US-China relationship have been upended in recent weeks after Washington broadened some tech restrictions and proposed levies on Chinese ships entering US ports.
China responded with parallel moves and outlined tighter export controls on rare earths and other critical materials. On Monday, the Ministry of Commerce convened an unusually large meeting in Beijing with foreign businesses, in an effort to reassure them that its latest export controls aren’t meant to restrict normal trade.

Mangalore University has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Thalassery-based Malabar Cancer Centre (Postgraduate Institute of Oncology Sciences and Research).
The objectives of the MoU are to impart quality education and training, conduct joint collaborative research, undertake multicentric research projects, and promote inter-institutional cooperation. Both institutions will jointly develop and foster education, training, research and professional activities, including student- and faculty-led projects.
Unique postgraduate programme in Karnataka
A media statement said that Mangalore University is the only state university in Karnataka to offer a postgraduate programme in Medical Physics. Malabar Cancer Centre (Postgraduate Institute of Oncology Sciences and Research) is an autonomous institution under the Health and Family Welfare Department of the Kerala government.
Mangalore University started a postgraduate course in Medical Physics (MSc in Medical Physics) in 2018. The teaching programmes of this course require the infrastructural facilities and professional expertise available at neighbouring medical institutions for conducting practical classes, teaching specialised course content, training through hospital postings, and internship programmes.
Leverage Malabar Cancer Centre facilities
Malabar Cancer Centre (Postgraduate Institute of Oncology Sciences and Research) has advanced diagnostic and treatment facilities. The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board recognises it for training Medical Physics students during their one-year internship programme.
The facilities and the expertise available at Malabar Cancer Centre (Postgraduate Institute of Oncology Sciences and Research) are immensely beneficial for the teaching and training of Medical Physics students and researchers at Mangalore University, the statement said.
Quoting PL Dharma, Vice Chancellor of Mangalore University, the statement said: “MoU provides an opportunity for both the institutions to conduct collaborative research on cancer incidences and advanced treatment modalities. The MoU will strengthen the MSc Medical Physics teaching and training programmes of Mangalore University.”
