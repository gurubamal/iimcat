Emphasising the shift in clean energy leadership from the US and EU to Asia, Africa, and Latin America, Ashish Khanna, Director General of the International Solar Alliance (ISA), underscored the importance of developing thought leadership from the Global South perspective to accelerate energy access to millions. In this direction, he said the upcoming Eight Assembly will deliberate on options such as distributed renewable energy (DRE) to fasttrack access to clean and affordable energy access. Excerpts:
What ails the global south, particularly Africa, in energy access and how can solar power help?
The world’s irony is that some of the best places for solar are also the places where solar is not happening. It’s happening everywhere else, but Africa, which has less than 1 per cent of solar investments. And the irony over that is they desperately need energy as an artery of economic growth.
For instance, Nigeria is resource rich in terms of energy, but it also has the world’s largest energy access gap. This is not allowing industries, SMEs and jobs to happen, including in agriculture for two reasons—they don’t have energy and those who have energy, it’s all diesel, which costs 25-30 cents (USD). Tariffs in these poor countries are 20-25 cents as generation is via heavy fuel oil or diesel.
So, if you are a consumer in any of these countries, you have three choices. Either take a utility tariff of 20-25 cents and get 5-6 hours supply, or have diesel, which is 25 cents, or have no power. Solar power is the answer. Even if it is not 4-5 cents, like in India and other places, and is say 8-9 cents, even after all the risk premiums, it will still be an economically viable option.
Why has the Global South become so critical for clean energy transition?
World is going through a huge shift. It took 25 years to do 1,000 gigawatt (GW) solar. The next 1,000 GW happened in just two years. This will become 4,500 GW in next three years. Seventy per cent of this is happening in Asia Pacific, which means that while some countries are receding, especially the US and EU, the leadership of this agenda is going to be more and more with Asia, Africa and Latin America, with Asia being the big thing. At what cost? Who will manufacture? How will this lead to energy security? Suddenly, this is going to become a lot more of a Global South driven agenda that I think is a very big global shift that we should all recognise.
You have emphasised the importance of DRE at several platforms for driving transition. What is the rationale?
DRE is going to become more important. First, if you have to work in Africa, because a lot of our focus is going to be on Africa, millions of people do not have access to energy. At least half of them are going to get it through DRE.
Second, unlike India, China and Vietnams of the world, where 98 per cent people got grid-based energy access, Africa is a different story. Which means innovation in models for mini grids, off grids, etc is going to be very different for energy access in Africa. Most of this will happen through solar, because Africa has huge solar potential and the need is to work out innovative business models in DRE. We worked with Nigeria in scaling up mini grids, where ISA collaborated to create an ecosystem right from financing to policy and regulatory reforms. That ecosystem challenge is now leading to 10,000 mini grids being planned in Nigeria, world’s largest mini grid market.
What is your vision for the ISA?
The first aspect is that ISA is different from institutions such as the ADB, etc. The biggest challenge, and where I feel most happy, is to identify a vision for ISA that is different and unique. This vision rests on four key pillars—enabling private sector investment in developing countries, building local capabilities, convening regional platforms, and developing thought leadership from the Global South perspective.
How can ISA empower farming communities in the Global South?
Distributed RE can catalyse the farm sector. Here, India’s experience with PM-KUSUM will create a pivot. I worked in Africa, they import $400 billion of food, and only 4 per cent of land is irrigated. So, when I met the Ethiopian head, or the president of Ghana, they say, our problem is that our farmers are working only 2-3 months on rain fed crops with no second or third crops because there’s no irrigation. They don’t have money for diverting rivers or canals. The only way for irrigation is solar crops. So, they are looking to India and other examples. As a pivot, Africa needs a big programme on solarisation of agriculture. Solar pumps will revolutionise the farm sector in such developing countries, particularly Africa.

Title   : Global stocks jump after US inflation data; US dollar nearly flat

The U.S. Consumer Price Index rose 0.3% last month, slightly less than the expected 0.4%, after climbing 0.4% in August. That reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its policy meeting next week.
"Today's inflation data shows that we're not in a crisis like 2022. Prices are growing, but at a controlled pace. That's good news if you're hoping the Fed will continue to cut interest rates," said Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Fed is expected to reduce rates two more times this year, with a quarter-percentage-point cut baked in for the October 28-29 meeting, according to LSEG calculations using rate futures. The Canadian dollar barely reacted to U.S. President Donald Trump saying on social media that he was ending all trade negotiations with Canada. The Canadian dollar was last nearly flat versus the greenback. Upbeat earnings reports also boosted Wall Street indexes. Ford Motor shares jumped 12.2% after the company beat third-quarter profit expectations. Analysts now expect third-quarter S&P 500 earnings growth of 10.4% year-on-year overall. That is up from estimated growth of 8.8% for the quarter at the start of the month, according to LSEG. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 472.51 points, or 1.01%, to 47,207.12, the S&P 500 rose 53.25 points, or 0.79%, to 6,791.69 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 263.07 points, or 1.15%, to 23,204.87. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq recorded their largest weekly percentage gains since August, while the blue-chip Dow logged its biggest Friday-to-Friday jump since June.
Five of the so-called Magnificent Seven U.S. companies at the center of the artificial intelligence boom, including Apple and Microsoft, are due to report earnings next week. U.S. stock markets have surged this year, and some analysts see signs of a bubble. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 6.28 points, or 0.63%, to 1,001.37 and hit an all-time high of 1,002.96.
European shares also closed at a record high on Friday, boosted by the cooler U.S. inflation data. The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended up 0.23%. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, fell 0.02% to 98.92, with the euro up 0.1% at $1.1629. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar strengthened 0.14% to 152.8.
Euro zone business activity unexpectedly grew faster in October, data showed. Euro zone government bond yields rose.
U.S. Treasury yields were little changed to modestly higher. The benchmark 10-year yield briefly turned lower after the CPI data but was last up 1.2 basis points (bps) at 4% . The yield, however, was down about 1 bp on the week, its fourth straight weekly decline.
Oil prices, which had risen 5% on Thursday after the U.S. sanctioned major Russian oil companies, eased on Friday as skepticism crept into the market about the Trump administration's commitment to the sanctions. U.S. crude fell 29 cents to settle at $61.50 a barrel and Brent eased 5 cents to settle at $65.94. Spot gold fell 0.57% to $4,101.29 an ounce.
