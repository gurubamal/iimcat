Bengaluru
Atlassian has announced a new R&D Centre in Bengaluru. Spanning 2 lakh plus square feet, the new space is four times the size of the company’s previous Bengaluru office, with the company deepening its investment in the region as a strategic R&D hub.
India is one of Atlassian’s fastest-growing R&D sites and plays a central role in the development of its products. Nearly 75 per cent of Atlassian’s India team are in R&D roles, contributing to some of its most strategic product development areas, from enterprise search and commerce to data residency and customer success. India has Atlassian’s largest workforce outside of Australia and the US, with more than 2,500 employees.
Rajeev Rajan, Chief Technology Officer at Atlassian said, “India continues to be one of our most important R&D hubs, and Bengaluru sits at the heart of this growth. This new world-class R&D Centre is more than just a larger space, it’s a symbol of our investment in the future of work, in distributed teamwork, and most importantly, in the exceptional talent we have here in India. The team is truly building cutting-edge solutions for our global market, and we’re thrilled to give them a vibrant space to connect, create, and collaborate.”
The space features flexible workstations, collaborative zones, wellness areas, and cutting-edge technology to support hybrid teams.
Avani Prabhakar, Chief People Officer at Atlassian said, “Our new R&D Centre is a destination for the incredible talent we have in India - designed for how we work today and how we will work tomorrow. Our Team Anywhere approach allows us to attract and retain top talent, regardless of location. We have Atlassians in almost every Indian State - tapping into the amazing skillsets across the country, as well as metro cities.”
The Bengaluru expansion is part of Atlassian’s global strategy to scale its operations. The new office joins Atlassian’s network of globally distributed workplaces and strengthens its presence in the broader Asia-Pacific region.
Atlassian established its presence in India in 2018 with a team of 60. Today, India is one of the fastest-growing regions in terms of headcount.
