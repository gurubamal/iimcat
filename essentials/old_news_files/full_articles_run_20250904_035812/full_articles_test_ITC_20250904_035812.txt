--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As part of the GST 2.0 roadmap rolled out in the Council’s 56th meeting, sin goods such as cigarettes, bidis, pan masala, gutkha, and other tobacco products have been explicitly kept out of the rate rationalisation that saw many FMCG and auto items move to lower tax brackets.
The shift to an RSP-based valuation model, from the current transaction value model (which benefits manufacturers like ITC), is aimed at plugging valuation leakages and ensuring full tax realisation. The effective implementation of the 40% GST slab will occur only after the outstanding cess-related loans are settled.
Currently, the tax on cigarettes comprises 28% GST plus compensation cess, which is a blend of ad valorem and specific duties. In the future regime, this cess will be phased out. However, ambiguity remains around the continuation of the National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) — a non-GST levy.
According to global brokerage firm Jefferies, even if NCCD continues at current levels, the overall tax incidence on cigarettes could decline by around 5% once the 40% RSP-based GST is implemented and the compensation cess is withdrawn. In such a scenario, the brokerage expects the tobacco industry to consider price reductions, especially for value-tier cigarettes, to counter illicit trade and recapture market share lost to unregulated players.
“While the short-term structure remains unchanged, clarity on timelines and the government’s intent to impose alternative levies, if any, will be crucial in assessing the sustainability of this relief,” one analyst noted.
“ITC could potentially benefit, as the shift to an ad-valorem rate of 40% (likely by year-end) implies a ~5ppt tax cut. Also, the regime potentially removes tax uncertainty, a positive for ITC,” said Jefferies in its note.
