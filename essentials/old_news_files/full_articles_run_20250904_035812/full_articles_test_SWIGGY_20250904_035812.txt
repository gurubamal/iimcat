Swiggy has once again raised its platform fee, pushing it to ₹15 per order — the third hike in less than a month. The latest increase follows a brief spike to ₹14 on Independence Day before the levy was rolled back to ₹12.
The platform fee is charged over and above delivery charges, GST and restaurant commissions, and is now an important revenue lever for both Swiggy and rival Zomato. The fee is not uniform, varying across cities, days, and even demand levels. With order volumes climbing again, Swiggy has moved the charge higher.
Industry executives estimate that Swiggy clocks more than 2 million food delivery orders daily. At this scale, each rupee added to the platform fee can translate into crores in incremental revenue every day. Zomato, too, has raised its levy to ₹12 per order this festive season.
Platform fees were introduced only in April 2023 at ₹2 per order. Since then, the charge has steadily crept up, rarely dropping below ₹10 since both companies experimented with higher fees during the year-end holiday season in 2023.
The sharp increases come as Swiggy struggles to rein in losses. On July 31, the Bengaluru-based company reported its net loss widened nearly 96 per cent year-on-year to ₹1,197 crore in the June quarter, compared with ₹611 crore a year earlier.
Losses had already stood at ₹1,081 crore in the March quarter. Much of the drag has been attributed to heavy investments in Instamart, Swiggy’s quick-commerce business.
Revenue from operations in the June quarter grew 54 per cent year-on-year to ₹4,961 crore, up from ₹3,222 crore in the same period last year, and 12 per cent higher than the March quarter’s ₹4,410 crore.
For food delivery players, platform fees — a relatively small line item for consumers — have emerged as a key lever to bolster margins. With input costs rising and discounts tapering, both Swiggy and Zomato are leaning on these charges to strengthen unit economics and push towards profitability.
At the NSE, Swiggy shares closed at Rs 429.5, up by 0.83 per cent.
