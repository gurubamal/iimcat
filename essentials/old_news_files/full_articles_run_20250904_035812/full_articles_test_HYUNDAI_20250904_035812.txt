Hyundai Motor India Foundation (HMIF), the CSR arm of Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL), in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras), on Wednesday launched ‘Hyundai Hope for Cancer’, an initiative dedicated to transforming paediatric cancer care in India.
As part of its multi-year commitment towards this cause, HMIF has allocated a social impact investment of ₹56 crore towards this project. The initiative involves the Hyundai Centre for Cancer Genomics, housed at IIT Madras’ main campus in Chennai. The centre features India’s first community-based Cancer Tissue Biobank, enabling advanced genomic research in paediatric leukaemia and lymphoma.
“By building an Indian childhood cancer genomic database, strengthening early detection and screening, and expanding access for underserved communities, the programme exemplifies ‘sabka prayas’ in action and reaffirms our commitment to equitable, technology-enabled healthcare,” Union Minister of Education Dharmendra Pradhan said in a statement.
The Centre will focus on genomic sequencing to identify genetic mutations, laying the foundation for a national paediatric cancer genome database and personalised treatment protocols. It will also serve as a hub for clinicians, researchers, pharmaceutical scientists, and global partners, contributing to international efforts such as the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).
Unsoo Kim, Managing Director, HMIL, said, “’Hyundai Hope for Cancer’ is not just about building infrastructure – it’s about healing, resilience, and hope. Every child deserves the chance to live a healthier, brighter tomorrow.”
Prof. V Kamakoti, Director, IIT Madras, said, “This research centre will catalyse breakthrough studies in paediatric oncology, resulting in improved diagnostics and targeted treatments. We thank Hyundai for trusting us to spearhead this mission.”
With a total sum of ₹56 crore committed towards this initiative, HMIF has also established a dedicated ₹3-crore Cancer Care Fund to ensure equitable access to treatment for economically-disadvantaged patients.
Over the next four years, the Centre will conduct 225+ cancer awareness and screening camps across Tamil Nadu, Haryana, and Maharashtra, reaching out to 1.27 Lakh individuals and vaccinating 5,000+ girl children against HPV.
