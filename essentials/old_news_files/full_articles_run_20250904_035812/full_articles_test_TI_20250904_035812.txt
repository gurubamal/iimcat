For India to achieve its goal of becoming a ‘Viksit Bharat’ (developed nation) by 2047, the agriculture sector must grow at a rate of 5 per cent. “If this 5 per cent agricultural growth is not achieved, India will not be able to reach its national development goal. It (5 per cent growth in agri) is essential to support the overall 8 per cent economic growth required for ‘Viksit Bharat’,” said Ramesh Chand, Member of NITI Aayog.
Chand drew parallels with economies like Japan, Korea, and China which registered a 5 per cent agricultural growth rate for at least 25-30 years during their transitions from middle-income to high-income stages.
“We also need a similar trajectory. Achieving this growth rate is also crucial for realising the goal of Sabka Vikas (inclusive development),” he said.
Addressing the inaugural of the two-day FPO Conclave organised by Nabard and Samunnati here on Wednesday, he rejected the claim that small farmers would disappear as ‘big fish would devour small fish’.
“Asia, not just India, has completely rejected this Western thinking. The reality of Asia is that small farmers will continue to exist in the future. We should move forward by making them our strength, rather than always portraying them as a weakness,” he said.
“If we want to make the FPO movement a driver of agricultural growth, we must consider all its aspects. The creation of an FPO alone is not sufficient. Once an FPO is created, we should ask questions like where it will get finance from? How will its capacity be built? Who are the other people involved with the FPO? FPOs cannot do everything on their own,” he said.
The fifth edition of the conclave, being organised by Nabard and Samunnati, has lined up deliberations on issues like: how to make FPOs enterprise-ready; FPO-led climate-smart agriculture technologies, and bringing the informal sector into the pension fold.
