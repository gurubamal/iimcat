Zydus Wellness’ acquisition of UK-based Comfort Click broadens its footprint across the UK, EU and USA. The transaction positions it to scale up its wellness range globally, a strategic step toward building a diversified, consumer-focused beauty, health & wellness portfolio.
A digital-first healthcare brand focused on VMS, the company is strong in the UK and Europe (with plans to enter the US). In FY25, it reported £134m revenue (₹1,600 crore) with a 2-/5-year CAGR of >57 per cent and £21m EBITDA (about ₹250 crore, around 16 per cent margin). Its portfolio is anchored by three brands: WeightWorld (plant-based supplements, vitamins, collagen, probiotics, sports nutrition), Maxmedix (paediatric VMS gummies) and Animigo (natural pet health supplements), which complemens Zydus’ nutrition & wellness range.
We expect the (Comfort Click) deal to be 1/20 per cent FY26/27e EPS accretive for Zydus while we introduce FY28e and expect further upside to our revenue/margin estimates for the acquired entity. We retain a Buy with a higher 12-month ₹2,995 TP, 30x Sep’27e EPS (₹2,570 earlier, 33x FY27e EPS) as the acquisition catapults the company into the over ₹5,000 crore revenue orbit with a focused play on health & wellness, which barely a few global companies can boast of.
Key risks: Failed product launches/acquisitions, price-based competition and rise in forex volatility, geopolitical factors affecting the international business.

Welcure Drugs & Pharmaceuticals has executed a Letter of Intent with Singapore-based Telexcell Trade Pte to facilitate strategic investment. Telexcell Trade will buy 25 per cent equity stake in Welcure Drugs at an indicative price of ₹20 per share.
The proposed all-cash investment is subject to due diligence, execution of definitive agreements and requisite corporate, shareholder and regulatory approvals, including those from SEBI, RBI and stock exchanges.
Both parties expect to complete the due diligence and documentation process within 90 days. This strategic investment is aimed at enhancing Welcure’s global footprint, leveraging growing opportunities in emerging markets.
Previously, the BSE-listed company announced plans to invest around ₹70–80 crore in establishing a modern cGMP-standard agro pharma research laboratory. The company also proposes to raise up to ₹80 crore via Qualified Institutional Placement to support this initiative and general corporate purposes.
