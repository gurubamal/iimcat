Speaking to ET Now, Gupta said the move comes at the right time, when India is facing external pressures from tariffs and weak global demand. "Quarter one earnings showed sluggishness in consumption. The government had earlier given tax relief to consumers, and this GST cut is another important measure. It makes goods meaningfully cheaper, reduces inflation, and boosts demand in key sectors like FMCG, consumer durables, and autos,” she said.
Domestic-oriented businesses to gain
Gupta believes investors should focus on companies with a strong domestic base rather than those exposed to global trade headwinds. “Chemicals, jewellery, and textiles face tariff risks, while domestic consumption, capital markets, and healthcare are better placed. The clear rotation is towards India-focused businesses,” she explained.Edelweiss MF has already positioned itself in line with this view. Gupta highlighted that the fund house launched a consumption fund earlier this year, with allocations in FMCG, consumer durables, and autos, across large, mid, and small-cap names. “We were already overweight on consumer stocks and autos, so this reform only strengthens our thesis,” she said.
Muted but positive market reaction
On the market’s response, Gupta noted that while the announcement was anticipated, the message was clear. “The removal of the 28% slab and simplification to two slabs—5% and 18%—sends a strong signal. Along with earlier tax cuts and RBI’s liquidity support, this creates positive messaging for the middle class,” she said.She added that the festive season, starting in October, combined with GST relief, should help corporate earnings recover in the second half of the year. “Q1 was weak and Q2 may remain tepid, but Q3 numbers should improve. Markets may remain range-bound in the short term, but earnings growth in the second half will be key for momentum,” Gupta said.

Bond market stable despite fiscal cost
On concerns about fiscal strain, Gupta said the bond market has absorbed the estimated Rs 48,000 crore revenue impact well. “On a GDP base, this is only about 7 bps. With India’s recent rating upgrade and the fact that this move is de-inflationary, bonds and currency markets should remain stable,” she added.(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
