Target: ₹1,400
CMP: ₹1,106.95
Nazara Technologies is well-positioned to benefit from the rapidly-expanding global and India gaming markets. India, despite being the second-largest (500Mn+) gamers’ base, remains under-monetised; In-App Purchases (IAP) conversion being less than 3 per cent and Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) of $8–9 as compared with $17–18 in China.
These offer significant upside as structural tailwinds (digital payments, 5G, Gen Z engagement) drive monetisation.
Nazara’s global pivot, through acquisitions, such as Fusebox and ZeptoLab IPs, enhances exposure to high-ARPU markets, while leveraging cost-efficient Indian development and hybrid monetisation models. With IAP mix expected to rise, from 19 per cent to about 35 per cent by FY28E, and freemium business registering double-digit growth, Nazara stands to scale up rapidly across casual, narrative and premium genres.
We initiate coverage on Nazara with a Buy rating and a 1-year forward SOTP-based TP of ₹1,400. We expect Revenue/ EBITDA to expand at a CAGR of 30.7/44.5 per cent over FY25-FY28E, driven by gaming-first focus and ramp-up of recent acquisitions.
Key risks: Regulatory headwinds in RMG, sub-scale presence beyond Nodwin and weak/ underperforming IPs impacting overall engagement and profitability

Delta Corp shares tumbled as much as 7.2% to Rs 88.35 on the BSE, while Nazara Technologies, India’s largest listed gaming company by market capitalization, fell 1.6%.
The 56th meeting of the GST Council, chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, cleared a “next-generation GST reform” package that reduces the current four-rate structure to two slabs of 5% and 18%, while introducing a 40% slab for luxury and demerit goods.
“For all specified actionable claims including betting, casinos, gambling, horse racing, lottery and online money gaming, GST rate of 40% will apply,” the finance ministry said in a release. The new rates will take effect from September 22.
While tickets for recognised sporting events sanctioned by national and international federations will remain taxed at the standard 18% above Rs 500, and exempt below that threshold, the new 40% rate will apply to IPL games and similar high-profile events.
The marathon Council meeting lasted 10.5 hours, during which the Centre and states hammered out the new tax structure.
Fallout for gaming companies
The sharper levy comes just a day after Delta Corp said it had shelved plans for a Rs 2,000–2,500 crore integrated resort-cum-casino township in Goa’s Dhargal, citing uncertainty around the GST framework.
India’s leading casino operator, which runs offshore and onshore casinos in Goa and Sikkim, reported a 36.1% rise in net profit to Rs 29.4 crore in the June quarter, but EBITDA fell 16.2% year-on-year to Rs 39.6 crore.
Nazara Technologies, a diversified player with interests in skill-based gaming and e-sports, also felt the heat from Thursday’s announcement, underscoring investor concerns over the broader gaming ecosystem.
The GST Council said the scrapping of the 12% and 28% slabs in favour of just 5% and 18% will lower costs for consumers and streamline compliance. The government described the measures as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s effort to make the indirect tax regime “efficient, equitable and growth-oriented.”
