The Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance has invited applications to fill a second Whole-Time Member (WTM) position at the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), with the tenure of Ananth Narayan set to conclude in October.
The new member can serve for up to five years, as specified in the appointment order, but must retire on attaining the age of 65. Re-appointment is possible. The WTM shall be entitled to a pay of ₹5,00,000 per month. The Ministry of Finance has set October 6 as the last date for applications.
SEBI currently has only three WTMs–Ananth Narayan G, Amarjeet Singh and Kamlesh Chandra Varshney–since the tenure of Ashwani Bhatia ended in May. The government is expected to fill up both these WTM vacancies together by the end of the year, according to market participants.
Narayan, who joined SEBI as WTM in 2022, is currently responsible for several critical departments, including Market Intermediaries Regulation and Supervision, Alternative Investment Funds and Foreign Portfolio Investors, the Integrated Surveillance Department, the Department of Economic and Policy Analysis, and the Information Technology Department.
Before his regulatory role, Narayan spent over two decades in financial markets, holding senior positions at Citibank, Deutsche Bank, and Standard Chartered. He has also served as Associate Professor at SP Jain Institute of Management & Research and as a member of various boards and regulatory committees.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"People often ask how I time the market. The simple answer is, I don’t. I’ve never believed in timing the market. Trying to guess which way the wind will blow tomorrow is a fool’s game. Markets rise and fall for reasons that don’t always make sense. Those who spend their time predicting daily market swings tend to spend a lot of time being wrong," Mobius said in a blog post.
Joseph Bernhard Mark Mobius, author of 12 books, has spent over 30 years investing in emerging markets. He has invested in more than 5,000 companies and managed assets worth Rs 40 billion. He is also nicknamed “The Bald Eagle” in a recent comic book.
Here are 5 key takeaways from his blog post:
1) Be ready for the right time
While Mobius is averse to timing, he emphasises that the investors should be prepared to find the right opportunities. "... you still have to be ready to move when the time is right. A couple of weeks ago, I mentioned in an interview that my new fund, the Mobius Emerging Opportunities Fund, was holding about 95% in cash. That got more attention than I expected. Some thought it meant that I’d given up on the market. I obviously haven’t. In fact, it’s the opposite. Two weeks later today, we’re down to 60% in cash. That’s just the nature of this business. One moment you’re waiting, the next you find something worth buying," he said.2) Acing midcaps
Mobius highlights how his focus has always been on businesses with strong fundamentals. "We look at companies of all sizes, but mid-caps tend to be particularly interesting. They’re not always on the radar of big institutional investors, and that’s where we often find value.Read more Here
3) On India
While conceding that India remains his top market at the moment, he is concerned about what he called "regulatory red tape". "Since our fund is new, we’ve found it slow and difficult to get proper access to the Indian market. The paperwork alone has held us back for months. If India wants to attract more long-term capital, simplifying these processes would go a long way," he said.Also Read: India still Mark Mobius’ biggest bet despite tariff heat, foresees swift FII comeback
4) US-China trade relations
Mobius said that while certain agreements have been reached, their implementation holds the key. In his view, non-tariff barriers will likely remain a sticking point. "This isn’t a situation where we can declare the negotiations finished and move on. It will be an ongoing process, with both sides needing to follow through," the market bull said.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.
