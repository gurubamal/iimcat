Country’s largest passenger vehicles (PVs) maker Maruti Suzuki India (MSIL) on Saturday said it is expected to sell around 51,000 units this Dhanteras, the highest-ever sales on this auspicious day, by the company.
“This time Dhanteras is spread over two days. The auspicious period started from 12:18 pm today (on Saturday) and will be there till 1:51 PM Sunday. As it is a Saturday some of the customers hesitate to buy metal, so they have postponed the deliveries to Sunday,” Partho Banerjee, Senior Executive Officer, Marketing and Sales, MSIL told reporters.
Last year the company sold 41,500 units in Dhanteras, which was the highest-ever before this year.
“We expect to reach 41,000 deliveries on Saturday and expecting another 10,000 customers to take deliveries tomorrow (Sunday). So, 51,000 total deliveries will be the highest-ever on Dhanteras. Our showrooms will be open quite late in the night to serve our customers,” Banerjee said.
He said this year, the traction is very good because of GST 2.0 and customers are enthusiastically coming to buy vehicles.
“Traction is very good. Everyday 14,000 bookings are coming. Since the day we had announced reduced prices, we have received 4.5-lakh bookings and of this one-lakh is for small cars. Retail is 3.25-lakh units which has broken all records for Maruti Suzuki with a growth of more than 50 per cent over similar period last year. There are still a few more days left for the festive season,” Banerjee said.
He added that the production team of the company is working Sunday also, to meet customer demand as it is running short of vehicles across models.
Meanwhile, Hyundai Motor India (HMIL) said that it was also witnessing strong customer demand and is estimated to deliver around 14,000 units this Dhanteras.
“This year, Dhanteras deliveries are spread across multiple days because of it being a Saturday. We are witnessing strong customer demand, with deliveries expected to be around 14,000 units, 20 per cent higher than last year. The positive momentum is driven by the festive spirit, a buoyant market environment and the encouraging impact of GST 2.0 reforms,” Tarun Garg, Whole-time Director and Chief Operating Officer, HMIL, said.
