Hyundai Motor India on late Tuesday named Tarun Garg as its new chief executive officer. An insider, Garg, whose expected appointment was first reported by Mint on 16 September, is the first Indian to lead the domestic arm of the South Korea-based automaker, and will also serve as the Managing Director of the company.
Garg will take on his new role effective January 1, 2026, subject to shareholder approval. He is currently a Whole-Time Director and COO of Hyundai Motor India Ltd.
Garg will succeed Unsoo Kim, who has led Hyundai Motor India since 2022 and will return to South Korea at the end of the year to assume a strategic role at the parent company, Hyundai Motor Co.
The company said that Garg's succession as CEO proves “Hyundai’s strong confidence in India’s leadership capabilities and India’s growing strategic importance within the global automotive landscape.”
“I am deeply honoured by the trust and confidence placed in me by Hyundai Motor Group. India’s automotive sector is in an exciting phase of transformation and I aim to contribute to HMIL’s continued growth in this market by stepping into this role,” Tarun Garg said of his appointment.
The South Korean automaker, which entered India in 1996, is the country's second-largest carmaker after Maruti Suzuki , with bestsellers such as the Creta, Venue, and i20.
Hyundai Motor India made the announcements ahead of its first investor day since the company's market debut last year.
The company's shares, which have climbed nearly 32 per cent since their listing, have gained 33 per cent so far in 2025 and traded largely flat on Wednesday.
Tarun Garg, a former Maruti Suzuki India executive who has been with Hyundai for six years, was the chief orchestrator of the Hyundai Motor India IPO in 2024.
The company said it plans to invest ₹450 billion ($5.07 billion) by fiscal 2030 to boost capacity and strengthen research and development, allocating about 60 per cent of the funds to R&D and the rest toward product upgrades and capacity expansion.
It also aims for double-digit core earnings margins of 11–14 per cent between fiscal 2026 and 2030, and projects a 7 per cent compound annual growth rate in domestic sales over the next five years.
Key Takeaways
- Tarun Garg's appointment signifies Hyundai's commitment to leveraging Indian leadership in its operations.
- The company plans a substantial investment in R&D and capacity enhancement to remain competitive.
- Hyundai aims for significant growth in domestic sales and profitability between 2026 and 2030.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Signalling India’s growing centrality in its global vision, South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Company (HMC) on Tuesday announced a ₹45,000-crore investment plan through 2030, aimed at expanding capacity, strengthening R&D and launching 26 new products, including electric and hybrid vehicles.
“India isn’t just important to Hyundai’s global strategy — India is Hyundai’s global strategy,” said Jose Munoz, President and CEO of HMC. “We are better when we are challenged, and in this market, we compete with some of the best manufacturers in the world.”
Hyundai’s aggressive bet on India comes amid intensifying competition from home-grown automakers such as Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra, both rapidly expanding their electric and SUV portfolios.
New models
The new product pipeline will include seven all-new models, six full-model changes, six variants, and seven facelifts or enhancements. Of these, five will be electric vehicles and eight hybrid-electric vehicles. The company will also foray into the multi-purpose vehicle and off-roader SUV segments, and introduce its first ‘Made in India’ compact electric SUV featuring Level 2 ADAS and a long driving range.
Hyundai aims to raise its domestic passenger vehicle market share to over 15 per cent, from around 13 per cent currently, and increase revenues 1.5 times to cross the Rs 1 lakh crore mark by FY2030 under its growth roadmap.
The automaker also confirmed plans to introduce its luxury Genesis brand in India, with the first locally produced model launching in 2027.
To drive this next phase of growth, Hyundai Motor India Ltd (HMIL) has appointed Tarun Garg—currently Whole-time Director—as its Managing Director and CEO, effective January 1, 2026. Garg will be the first Indian to lead Hyundai’s India operations in the company’s three-decade history here.
Focus area
While continuing to strengthen its SUV lineup, Hyundai will also focus on the entry-level segment to capture first-time buyers who are likely to upgrade in future. “India is not one market but two Indias,” Munoz said. “Many two-wheeler and three-wheeler users aspire to own a passenger car, and we want to be part of that journey.”
Munoz added that the company plans to manufacture all EVs locally to improve competitiveness and ensure better returns. “We remain deeply committed to creating long-term value for shareholders by announcing a dividend payout guidance of 20-40 per cent,” he said.
