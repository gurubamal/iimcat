The order book of Cupid, a leading condom and FMCG product company, has touched ₹100 crore ($12 million). Most of the orders in the B2B space across male and female condoms and lubricants is scheduled to be executed in Q2 and Q3 of FY26, said the company.
These orders are from international government tenders in South Africa, Tanzania and Kenya besides international agencies such as WHO/ UNFPA and NGOs.
In addition, Cupid’s IVD Kits are witnessing strong traction in international markets, supported by steady B2B export orders from several African and Asian countries, it said.
The company expects orders from European markets starting Q4 FY26, following the CE Certification of four IVD Kits. It also anticipates significant female condom orders from Brazil having secured L1 in the recent tender comprising 6.25 million pieces valued at approximately ₹40 crore with additional future orders expected from Brazil, along with new tender-based orders for Cupid female condoms from Tanzania, one of the largest markets in East Africa.
These orders are expected in Q2 and Q3 of FY26.
The opportunities will be further augmented by regular orders under the new five-year South Africa tender, scheduled to commence in Q4 FY26, under which Cupid is eligible to supply the country’s entire requirement for condoms.
Simultaneously, the Cupid B2C FMCG branded business team is exploring new markets in the GCC, African continent and Indian subcontinent to expand the Cupid Branded Business internationally beyond India by FY27.
Aditya Kumar Halwasiya, Chairman and Managing Director, Cupid said the current confirmed order book is the highest in the company’s history for the company’s top three products and provides strong revenue visibility in coming quarters.
In addition, the expected female condom orders from Brazil, new tender opportunities in Tanzania and commencement of the South Africa five-year tender will significantly enhance international business, he said.
Further, the growing traction of IVD kits and planned expansion into new B2C international markets position Cupid well for sustainable growth in FY26 and beyond, he added.
