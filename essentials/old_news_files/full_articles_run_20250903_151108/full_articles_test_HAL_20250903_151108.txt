Haleon (formerly known as GSK Consumer Healthcare) on Wednesday announced the retirement of Navneet Saluja, General Manager for the India Subcontinent Business Unit, effective October 31 .
The company’s portfolio includes brands such as Sensodyne, Eno, Iodex , Crocin, Centrum and Otrivin among others.
Saluja joined Haleon in 2008 as Sales Director and later moved to Dubai, where he served as General Manager for the Middle East, and later as BU GM for the Middle East & Africa.
“In 2018, he returned to India to lead the ISC business during a pivotal phase, steering the landmark Horlicks divestment to HUL and laying the foundation for Haleon’s independent identity. Under his leadership, Haleon India launched its own distribution network, a game-changing move that accelerated growth, deepened consumer connection, and enhanced agility,” the company said in a statement.
