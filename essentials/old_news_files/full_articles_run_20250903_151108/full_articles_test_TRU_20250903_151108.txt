The assets under management (AUM) of the National Pension System (NPS) has breached the ₹15-trillion mark, according to Suparna Tandon, Chief Executive Officer of NPS Trust.
Addressing the fifth FPO Conclave 2025 organised by Nabard and Samunnati here on Wednesday, she said that millions of citizens had begun to trust the NPS architecture.
“Our responsibility is to ensure that farmers, too, are seamlessly included in this journey of financial security. By building awareness, simplifying access, and working with institutions like FPOs, we can ensure that no farmer is left behind in securing their future,” she said.
Earlier Mamta Rohit, Executive Director of Pension Fund Regulatory and Development (PFRDA) made a presentation on the future roadmap for the pension scheme.
Giving examples on how people can build a robust corpus that can ensure a substantial pension, she said that the scheme’s comprehensive design also ensured financial stability for women, who were found to be facing challenges towards the evening of their lives, and children.
