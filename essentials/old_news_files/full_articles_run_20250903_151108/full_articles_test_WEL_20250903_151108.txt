Krystal Integrated Services Limited (KISL) has secured a five-year contract worth ₹370 crore from the Commissionerate of Social Welfare, Pune, to provide mechanised housekeeping and outsourced manpower services across welfare institutions in Maharashtra.
The contract covers a vast network of facilities, including over 2,800 hostels for boys and girls, 93 residential schools, 19 Scheduled Ashram Schools, 6 Industrial Training Institutes, 34 Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Nyay Bhavans and 54 old age homes. The engagement also extends to cooperative societies, spinning mills and a residential school in Pune for children of sweepers.
The Commissionerate of Social Welfare operates one of India’s most extensive welfare ecosystems, serving thousands of students, senior citizens and vulnerable communities across the State. The contract represents one of the most significant socially impactful engagements in Krystal’s government portfolio.
“This contract allows us to serve the backbone of Maharashtra’s social welfare system,” said Sanjay Dighe, CEO and Whole Time Director of KISL. “We believe facility management is about enabling growth and empowerment.”
Mumbai-headquartered KISL, established in 2000, provides integrated facility management services across healthcare, education, government administration, transportation infrastructure and retail sectors. The company expanded its operations from 1,962 to 3,209 locations between FY21 and FY25, with its customer base growing from 262 to 461 clients.
The shares of Krystal Integrated Services Limited (KISL) were trading on the NSE at ₹700 up by ₹2.85 or 0.41 per cent at 3.05 pm.

Target: ₹2,995
CMP: ₹2,330.00
Zydus Wellness’ acquisition of UK-based Comfort Click broadens its footprint across the UK, EU and USA. The transaction positions it to scale up its wellness range globally, a strategic step toward building a diversified, consumer-focused beauty, health & wellness portfolio.
A digital-first healthcare brand focused on VMS, the company is strong in the UK and Europe (with plans to enter the US). In FY25, it reported £134m revenue (₹1,600 crore) with a 2-/5-year CAGR of >57 per cent and £21m EBITDA (about ₹250 crore, around 16 per cent margin). Its portfolio is anchored by three brands: WeightWorld (plant-based supplements, vitamins, collagen, probiotics, sports nutrition), Maxmedix (paediatric VMS gummies) and Animigo (natural pet health supplements), which complemens Zydus’ nutrition & wellness range.
We expect the (Comfort Click) deal to be 1/20 per cent FY26/27e EPS accretive for Zydus while we introduce FY28e and expect further upside to our revenue/margin estimates for the acquired entity. We retain a Buy with a higher 12-month ₹2,995 TP, 30x Sep’27e EPS (₹2,570 earlier, 33x FY27e EPS) as the acquisition catapults the company into the over ₹5,000 crore revenue orbit with a focused play on health & wellness, which barely a few global companies can boast of.
Key risks: Failed product launches/acquisitions, price-based competition and rise in forex volatility, geopolitical factors affecting the international business.
