Krystal Integrated Services Limited (KISL) has secured a five-year contract worth ₹370 crore from the Commissionerate of Social Welfare, Pune, to provide mechanised housekeeping and outsourced manpower services across welfare institutions in Maharashtra.
The contract covers a vast network of facilities, including over 2,800 hostels for boys and girls, 93 residential schools, 19 Scheduled Ashram Schools, 6 Industrial Training Institutes, 34 Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Nyay Bhavans and 54 old age homes. The engagement also extends to cooperative societies, spinning mills and a residential school in Pune for children of sweepers.
The Commissionerate of Social Welfare operates one of India’s most extensive welfare ecosystems, serving thousands of students, senior citizens and vulnerable communities across the State. The contract represents one of the most significant socially impactful engagements in Krystal’s government portfolio.
“This contract allows us to serve the backbone of Maharashtra’s social welfare system,” said Sanjay Dighe, CEO and Whole Time Director of KISL. “We believe facility management is about enabling growth and empowerment.”
Mumbai-headquartered KISL, established in 2000, provides integrated facility management services across healthcare, education, government administration, transportation infrastructure and retail sectors. The company expanded its operations from 1,962 to 3,209 locations between FY21 and FY25, with its customer base growing from 262 to 461 clients.
The shares of Krystal Integrated Services Limited (KISL) were trading on the NSE at ₹700 up by ₹2.85 or 0.41 per cent at 3.05 pm.
