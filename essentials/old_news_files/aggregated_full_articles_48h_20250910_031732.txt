Title   : UK Seeks Greater Business Access in China as Kyle Resumes Talks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UK Business Secretary Peter Kyle is set to push China for greater market access to British businesses, as he attends the first high-level trade discussions between the two countries since 2018.
Kyle, who replaced Jonathan Reynolds in a cabinet reshuffle on Friday, will land in Beijing on Wednesday, according to a statement from the Department for Business and Trade. He’s looking to conclude a trade package which will make it easier for British carmakers to export to China, remove barriers on items such as cattle hides, sheep skins and genetic material for pig breeding, and help UK education firms get their qualifications and services recognized in China.
The resumption of the UK-China Joint Economic and Trade Commission talks after a 7-year hiatus amid rising tensions between the two nations comes as Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer is pushing to boost economic growth in Britain, partly by increasing trade opportunities. The package of market access alterations Kyle is pursuing could be worth more than £1 billion to UK companies, according to his department.
Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson suspended the economic dialog following China’s crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong in 2019. But while the Conservatives tried to distance the UK from China, banning companies such as Huawei from infrastructure contracts over fears of spying and worries about economic security, Starmer is trying to cautiously improve relations. In an emailed statement, DBT said it was pursuing a “pragmatic, careful and confident relationship” with the Asian super-power, which is forecast to contribute 23% of global growth between 2023 and 2050.
The visit was planned before Starmer’s cabinet overhaul, when Kyle was promoted from his previous post as science and innovation secretary. The minister, who is arriving in China straight from a visit to Washington, where he met with senior White House advisers, will need to balance the UK’s relationship with China against its US ties. That’s because President Donald Trump has been clear that he wishes to see western allies distance themselves from Beijing.
“Serious and strategic engagement with the world’s foremost economic players is what will deliver for working people and businesses across the UK,” Kyle said. “More discussions and direct engagement with China will ensure trade between us can flourish, strengthen our national security, and create space to raise concerns constructively where needed.”
According to DBT figures, nearly £2 billion of exports to China were supported by the UK government in the last financial year, including a broadcast deal signed by football’s Premier League with China Mobile-owned streaming platform Migu, a partnership between Oxford University Press and the National Library of China, and a strategic agreement signed by health sciences company Cultech Group to sell products on the Chinese market.
Kyle intends to raise human rights and business competition concerns during his meetings with Chinese peers, according to his department. He will also co-chair the first Industrial Cooperation Dialogue between the two countries since 2022, aiming to promote cooperation on industrial decarbonization and the digital economy.

Title   : Dev Accelerator IPO opens for subscription today; GMP at 16%: Should you bid? 
Source  : economictimes.indiatimes.com
Published: 2025-09-10T02:40:10
Fetched : 2025-09-10T03:18:35.637976
URL     : https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/dev-accelerator-ipo-opens-for-subscription-today-gmp-at-16-should-you-bid/articleshow/123798186.cms
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Price band and IPO details
The book-built issue is priced in the band of Rs 56–61 per share and comprises a fresh issue of 2.35 crore shares. At the upper price band, Dev Accelerator is valued at 305x FY25 earnings and 3.5x sales, giving it a post-issue market cap of Rs 550 crore. Analysts flag the IPO as expensive compared with peers such as Awfis Space Solutions, which trades at 58x earnings with a higher return profile.
Company overview
Founded in 2017, Dev Accelerator provides managed office solutions, co-working spaces, and design-build services.

The company has carved out a leadership position in Tier-2 markets while maintaining a presence in major metros such as Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Pune. As of May 2025, it operated 28 centres across 11 cities with 14,144 seats and over 8.6 lakh sq. ft. under management.
Its focus is on large corporations, offering fully customized offices with lease terms of 5–9 years and lock-in periods of 3.5–5 years. The company also offers facility management, payroll processing, and IT/ITES services through its subsidiaries. Clients include large MNCs, domestic corporates, and SMEs.
Financials
Revenues rose 47% year-on-year to Rs 1,59 crore in FY25, while consolidated profit after tax stood at Rs 1.8 crore, up from Rs 40 lakh in FY24. The turnaround follows heavy losses in FY23. Despite growth, margins remain thin, with PAT margin at just 1.1%.
Strengths
The company’s long-term contracts provide stable revenue visibility. Its high occupancy levels (87% in FY25) and strong foothold in Tier-2 cities position it well to benefit from the rapid expansion of India’s flexible office market, expected to nearly double over the next five years. Diversification into IT, payroll, and facility management services adds to client stickiness.
Risks
The company remains dependent on a limited set of centres, especially in Gujarat, which contributed over 30% of FY25 revenues. Profitability is still fragile, with heavy depreciation and finance costs eating into earnings. It also relies on leased properties, exposing it to rental cost escalations. High client concentration and competition from larger peers are additional risks.
Should you subscribe?
Anand Rathi Research has recommended a “Subscribe – Long Term” rating on the IPO. "While near-term valuations look stretched, the firm believes DevX’s leadership in Tier-2 markets and expansion into new centres, including its first international project in Sydney, provide a structural growth story."

Title   : Staffing Crisis Unfolds at BLS With a Third of Leadership Jobs Now Vacant

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Bloomberg) -- Help is wanted at the Bureau of Labor Statistics — a lot of help.
A third of high-level roles at the agency that produces marquee numbers on US jobs and inflation are vacant, according to the BLS website. While the commissioner role has been temporarily filled, a range of other leadership positions that oversee various aspects of employment statistics and regional field operations sit empty.
Many of those staffers, who had been at the agency for decades, took the Trump administration’s deferred resignation offers in recent months, according to people familiar with the matter. That presented a challenge for the agency of roughly 2,000 career employees even before President Donald Trump fired the commissioner last month.
“When you don’t have leaders to help prioritize and to identify which things you’re going to do, and you have less bandwidth, then what falls behind are improvements,” said Erica Groshen, who served as BLS commissioner during the Obama administration. Those could include efforts like modernizing surveys and boosting response rates, she added.
Such issues have been at the heart of why the agency has been under so much scrutiny lately. Though a lack of leadership isn’t the root cause of these challenges, it does make it more difficult for the BLS to implement necessary reforms and training.
Trump cited outsize revisions and the need for more accurate BLS data when he dismissed the agency’s head, Erika McEntarfer, last month. While those adjustments were unusually large, revisions to jobs data are routine as the agency collects more responses over time.
“For years the BLS has been failing America’s businesses, policymakers, and families by publishing jobs reports with vastly inaccurate data. The prior leadership at the BLS did not take any action to increase response rates or modernize data collection methods to improve the agency’s accuracy,” Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement. “These problems have existed for years and President Trump is actually taking steps to fix them.”
In addition to the revisions the BLS publishes each month, the data is also subject to an annual adjustment in which the figures are benchmarked to a more accurate but less timely series. A preliminary estimate of that revision due Tuesday may mark down job growth in the year through March by roughly 800,000 or more, some economists say.
‘High Priority’
Filling senior roles will be a “very high priority” for the next commissioner as the BLS needs leaders to make hiring decisions, said Groshen, who also co-chairs a BLS advocacy group. Total staffing is down around 20% since Trump took office, she said.
But with a federal hiring freeze in place until Oct. 15, it’s unclear whether those lower-level positions, like those responsible for data collection and analysis, will be filled anytime soon.
The administration is taking steps to fill the commissioner role — the only political appointee at the BLS — and has picked EJ Antoni for the position. Antoni currently serves as chief economist at the Heritage Foundation and is awaiting a Senate confirmation hearing. William Wiatrowski, a long-time BLS veteran, is serving as commissioner in the interim.
The July jobs report, released Aug. 1, showed sizable downward revisions to the prior two months — the biggest since the pandemic. To Ron Hetrick, who oversaw the monthly employment statistics program at the BLS in the 1990s, those deserved more than the statement’s mere mention that they were “larger than normal” and that they were due to additional responses and the recalculation of seasonal factors.
“I thought BLS needed to own up to the fact that it did an incredibly poor job of explaining what was going on. I was explaining it on their behalf,” said Hetrick, who’s now principal economist at Lightcast, a provider of labor market data. “That just didn’t seem right to me.”
Not only is the BLS grappling with the departure of experienced personnel, it’s also lost a number of junior staff with technical skills due to Trump’s firing of probationary employees, Groshen said.
Some of these issues predate the Trump administration, with inflation-adjusted funding declining over many years.
“The integrity of BLS data came under fire following significant revisions in the Biden administration, and those who are pointing the finger now are the same ones who have consistently complained about a lack of resources for years without making any effort to improve their practices,” said Courtney Parella, a spokesperson for the Department of Labor, which oversees the BLS.
With less institutional knowledge than usual and Trump’s termination of voluntary advisory committees to the BLS and other government agencies, it’s unclear where the next set of directives will come from to protect and enhance the nation’s gold standard economic data.
“There is a very particular culture in the BLS that they worked very hard to promote. And that depends a lot on leadership — leading by example and training,” said Groshen. “And when you have a lot of people being thrust into roles that they haven’t been prepared for and trained for for a long time, it’s a risk.”

Title   : Broker’s call: Ellenbarrie (Buy)
Source  : www.thehindubusinessline.com

Fetched : 2025-09-10T03:34:34.450655
URL     : https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/brokers-call-ellenbarrie-buy/article70029269.ece
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Target: ₹680
CMP: ₹553.55
Ellenbarrie Industrial Gases (ELLEN), with a legacy of over five decades, is among the oldest industrial gas companies in India. The company manufactures and supplies a broad portfolio of gases, including oxygen, nitrogen, argon, hydrogen, helium and carbon dioxide. These gases are integral to essential systems and applications across industries such as steel, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, engineering, defence, energy and food & beverages, supporting recurring demand and fostering long-term customer relationships.
The company’s business model is underpinned by strong customer retention and high entry barriers, arising from the core nature of industrial gases and the structural rigidity of long-term pipeline contracts that limit supplier substitution.
Geographical expansion continues to be a core priority of Ellen, as it is progressing toward a pan-India footprint by increasing its presence in the northern and western parts of India while strengthening its manufacturing capabilities in the eastern and southern regions.
We expect a CAGR of 39/49/52 per cent in revenue/EBITDA/PAT over FY25-28. Ellen is currently trading at 49.8x/30.6x/25x FY26E/FY27E/FY28E PE. We initiate coverage on Ellen with a Buy rating and a TP of ₹680, based on about 40x FY27E EPS.
Key downside risks: dependent on key customer relationships, prolonged disruption in facilities, slower demand in key sectors like steel.

Title   : At multi-year highs: Prime Focus, BGR Energy among 8 stocks witness 5-year swing high breakout 
Source  : economictimes.indiatimes.com

URL     : https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/at-multi-year-highs-prime-focus-bgr-energy-among-8-stocks-witness-5-year-swing-high-breakout/slideshow/123798566.cms
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the NSE list of stocks with a market cap over Rs 1,000 crore, 14 stocks witnessed a 5-year swing high at the close on September 9, suggesting bullishness in counters, according to stockedge.com's technical scan data. Of these, we have highlighted the top 8 that posted gains of more than 2.5%.
A 5-year swing high represents the highest price a stock has reached within a five-year timeframe. This level acts as a significant resistance point where the price has historically struggled to go beyond. This occurrence may be seen as a bullish sign, indicating the potential for further upward movement in the stock. However, it's worth noting that this is different from a 5-year breakout, which occurs when a stock's price surpasses a key resistance level that has held for five years or longer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The company has requested the apex court to quash the demands and direct the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to reassess them under updated verification guidelines.
In its petition, Vodafone Idea has urged the court to instruct the DoT to conduct a comprehensive reassessment of AGR dues based on the ‘Deduction Verification Guidelines’ issued on February 3, 2020.
The telco is challenging what it says are arithmetical and duplication-related errors in the earlier calculations, which formed the basis of the government’s demand.
This legal development could inject volatility into the stock, as investors assess the implications for the company’s long-term liabilities and repayment schedule. Vodafone Idea’s total AGR dues stand as part of the Rs 93,520 crore burden shared among telecom operators, stemming from a long-standing dispute over the definition of revenue used to calculate statutory dues.
The company’s plea comes after previous re-evaluation attempts were rejected.
The Supreme Court had, in July 2021, dismissed similar applications from telecom players, including Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel. The top court held its earlier ruling from 2020 as final, directing telecom operators to clear their dues over a 10-year period ending March 2031.
As per that 2020 order, telcos were to pay 10% of the total dues by March 31, 2021, with the remainder to be paid in annual instalments. The court had categorically stated that no further dispute or reassessment should be entertained regarding the dues assessed by the DoT.

Vodafone Idea has now sought an early hearing on its fresh petition, filed on September 8, in a bid to reopen the matter based on updated procedural guidelines. The market will be closely watching for any judicial response or investor sentiment around the company’s move, which could have a material impact on its balance sheet if relief is granted.

Vodafone Idea moves Supreme Court against additional ₹9,450 cr AGR dues demand
Vodafone Idea has moved the Supreme Court challenging DoT’s fresh ₹9,450 crore demand in dues towards adjusted gross revenue, arguing it violates a 2020 ruling.
Vodafone Idea Ltd has filed a fresh writ petition in the Supreme Court challenging an additional demand of ₹9,450 crore by the Union government towards adjusted gross revenue dues.
The Supreme Court had on 18 March 2020 locked Vodafone Idea’s AGR dues till 2016-17 based on calculations by the department of telecommunications (DoT), adding that no self-assessment or re-assessment of the dues would be permitted.
But DoT has now sought additional payments for up to 2018-19, Vodafone Idea said in its petition dated 8 September, which Mint has seen.
Of the ₹9,450 crore, the additional demand raised by DoT from Idea Group and Vodafone Idea (post merger in August 2018) was at ₹2,774 crore, while the demand against Vodafone Group (pre-merger) was ₹6,675 crore, according to the petition.
The beleaguered telecom operator owes about ₹83,400 crore in AGR dues to the government, with annual payments of ₹18,000 crore beginning in March. Overall, Vodafone Idea’s total dues to the government stand at around ₹2 trillion, including penalty and interest.
“A sum of approx ₹9,450 Crores has been computed by the DoT which is to be considered with reference to the scheduled payment due on 31 March 2026. In this sum of approx ₹9,450 crores, the majority amount of approx ₹5,606 crores (as on 31.03.2025) is for the period up to FY 2016-17 which has already been crystalized by this Hon'ble Court," Vodafone Idea said in its petition.
The telecom operator requested the Supreme Court to quash DoT’s additional demands for AGR payments up to FY17, and to order a comprehensive reassessment and reconciliation of all AGR dues for that period. Adjusted gross revenue represents a portion of a telecom company's gross revenue that’s considered towards regulatory payments.
The substantial liability created by the AGR demand threatened the company’s existence and “the livelihood of thousands of employees working directly or indirectly" with it, Vodafone Idea said in its petition. The company has nearly 198 million users and more than 18,000 employees.
‘Erroneous math’
According to Vodafone Idea’s latest petition, DoT’s additional demand pertains to dues involving licence fees (calculated as a percentage of AGR). If payment demands towards additional spectrum usage charges for the period up to FY17 are also considered, the amount is about ₹6,800 crore as on 31 March 2025, it said.
In a letter dated 13 August to Vodafone Idea, DoT said revised or updated outstanding licence fee dues up to FY19 had not been tabulated in the Supreme Court’s order dated 1 September 2020.
The department told the telecom operator that the licence fee dues were calculated with interest and interest on penalty up to October 2019, and updated up to 31 March 2025 with interest calculated at a rate of 8% per annum. Mint has seen a copy of the letter.
In response, Vodafone Idea in a letter dated 28 August to DoT said that it cannot raise any revised or updated AGR demand for the period up to FY17 without seeking clarification on the Supreme Court’s September 2020 judgement.
The company informed DoT that it was not admitting any liability other than periodic interest on ₹58,254 crore. It also called out DoT’s calculation on the licence fee dues for FY18 and FY19 as erroneous.
The government owns nearly 49% stake in Vodafone Idea after converting nearly ₹53,083 crore of dues into equity in two tranches—in February 2023 and April 2025.
In April, Bharti Airtel Ltd urged DoT to convert its AGR dues of about ₹40,000 crore into equity, which would give the government a 3-4% stake in India’s second-largest telecom operator. The company said in August it was ready to pay the dues but that it expected the government to extend it the same relief given to any other telecom operator.
Quest for survival
In 2019, the Supreme Court ruled that Vodafone Idea and its peers needed to pay statutory liabilities on AGR, including non-telecom revenue, to the government. But there were massive gaps between the telecom department’s calculations and self-assessed dues by telecom operators.
For Vodafone Idea, DoT calculated total dues at ₹58,254 crore against the company’s estimate of ₹21,500 crore.
In August 2024, the Supreme Court rejected curative petitions filed by Vodafone Idea and other operators seeking relief in the apex court’s 2019 ruling.
In May this year, the Supreme Court rejected Vodafone Idea’s plea for a waiver on ₹45,000 crore in interest and penalties on its ₹83,400 crore AGR dues. A four-year moratorium on these payouts ends this month.
“Although, it has been the Petitioner’s (Vodafone Idea) case itself that the amount of ₹58,254 crores is erroneous and riddled with clerical and arithmetical errors. However, in light of the directions passed by this Hon'ble Court, petitioner is unable to seek rectification of the demands," the company said in its latest petition.
According to Vodafone Idea, the directions passed by the Supreme Court also restrain the government from raising additional AGR dues for the period till FY17 over and above the amount of ₹58,254 crore.
Vodafone Idea has also requested the government for relief on its AGR dues. Without such relief, the company told the government and the Supreme Court earlier that it won’t be able to survive beyond the current financial year.
“It is important to note that this payment of approx. ₹18,000 crores which has to be paid on a yearly basis for the next 6 years, is far in excess of the Company’s operational cash generation capacity each year," the company told the Supreme Court in May.
Vodafone Idea’s annual operational cash generation was in the range of ₹8,400-9,200 crore the previous three financial years, it had said.
“Our request to the government has been that let us resolve this (AGR issue) earlier than before the deadline of March so that banks get clarity and we can proceed with bank funding," Akshaya Moondra said during his final earnings call as chief executive of Vodafone Idea on 18 August.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Global Fintech Fest that kicks off on October 7 this year will see Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sharing the stage with the UK’s PM Keir Starmer.
With the theme ‘Empowering finance for a better world powered by AI,’ the event has a star-studded speaker lineup including Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Minister of Railways, Information & Broadcasting and Electronics & Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw, RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra and Sebi chairperson Tuhin Kanta Pandey.
This year GFF is being held in the midst of tariff-induced turmoil in the global economy, while India is at the receiving end of 50 per cent duty imposed on its goods entering the US.
Free trade agreement
India has already signed a free trade agreement with the UK in July, which will significantly lower trade barriers between the two countries.
In a curtain raiser for the event, it was revealed that the event, which usually attracts large crowds, will be attended by 500-odd investors from across the globe, while over 5000 corporates are expected to be at the event, including fintechs from India and overseas.
The event is also a platform for start-up founders to connect with potential investors and Gaurav Chopra, Executive Director, Payments Council of India said while deal closures may not actually conclude, conversations were likely to take place. Last year, for instance, deals worth about $2-3 billion that concluded, had their origins in the event.
A high powered delegation from Saudi Arabia will also marking its presence, including Saudi Investment Authority and other institutions. They had approached the GFF convening committee and have stated their intent to meet up with pre-drawn list of 60 startups.
Other attendees include Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Deutsche Bundesbank of the Federal Republic of Germany, Banque de France, and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA.
With AI dominating corporate conversations it was felt that it should be the theme for the conference, but with financial inclusion at the core of it.

Title   : Licious shuts plant-based arm UnCrave to focus on profitability ahead of IPO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meat and seafood brand Licious has discontinued its plant-based meat vertical UnCrave as it doubles down on its core business and profitability targets ahead of a planned public listing next year.
Launched in 2022, UnCrave was positioned as a meat alternative for Licious customers, competing with the likes of Beyond Meat and Shaka Harry. The company had been gradually winding down the vertical, which is now fully discontinued, according to people aware of the development.
“The company wants to achieve profitability and is prioritising the expansion of its store network and quick-service offerings,” said a source close to the matter.
The move comes as Licious intensifies its focus on scaling offline presence. While quick commerce players such as Blinkit and Swiggy Instamart remain important revenue channels, the company has been executing an omnichannel strategy, adding more brand-owned stores to strengthen customer reach. Licious currently operates over 15 outlets across Delhi NCR and Bengaluru.
Founded in 2015 by Vivek Gupta and Abhay Hanjura, Licious runs a farm-to-fork model, controlling the entire back-end supply chain from sourcing to delivery. Backed by investors, including Temasek, 3one4 Capital and IIFL, the company has raised more than $550 million to date.
Financially, Licious has been tightening its losses. In FY24, net loss narrowed 44 per cent to ₹293.77 crore from ₹528.5 crore in FY23. Revenue, however, slipped 8.4 per cent to ₹685.05 crore from ₹748 crore in the previous fiscal year.
With the shutdown of UnCrave and an increased focus on offline expansion, Licious is betting that its core fresh meat and seafood offerings will pave the way for profitability and build investor confidence as it gears up for an IPO.

Title   : Marine exports to the EU set to rise as bloc approves 102 Indian fish units

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spelling some relief for Indian seafood exporters hit by US tariffs, the EU has approved 102 additional Indian fishery establishments for export to the bloc, which is likely to immediately increase exports of the item to the bloc by 20 per cent, according to the government.
Simultaneously, there is positive movement in the India-EU free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations taking place in New Delhi this week with things progressing fast, Commerce & Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said.
“This (the decision on listing 102 new fishery units) follows a series of meetings in the EU and New Delhi, in which the Union Minister of Commerce and Industry and senior officials participated… Reflects India’s commitment to food safety, traceability and compliance with EU regulations and strengthens its position as a trusted supplier of high-quality seafood,” per a government statement.
India’s annual export of seafood to the EU, currently at $1.1 billion, is expected to immediately increase 20 per cent, and subsequently it would increase further, an official said.
The items that are expected to benefit include aquaculture shrimps, squid, cuttle fish, octopus and sea cod, according to the Commerce Department.
As India’s seafood export to the US, the biggest market for Indian fish exporters, is set to take a big hit because of the 50 per cent tariffs imposed on Indian goods, the EU’s move is especially welcome. India’s shrimp exports in 2024-25 was $4.88 billion, accounting for 66 per cent of the total seafood exports.
The EU is the second largest importer of Indian seafood exports, while other significant markets include China, Japan, Vietnam and Thailand.
“The approval given by the EU to 102 Indian fishery establishments, some of which were earlier denotified, demonstrates the confidence the bloc is expressing in India’s quality adherence. Coming at a time when exporters are facing trouble in the US, it is a relief,” the official said.
India-EU FTA talk
On the India-EU FTA talks, Goyal said that talks were progressing fast.
“By the time my counterparts Maros Sefcovic, the EU Trade Commissioner and EU Agriculture Commissioner Christophe, come to India, I think we will be quite set to try and conclude the agreement substantially,” Goyal told reporters on Tuesday.
Sefcovic and Hansen are likely to visit India this week.
India and the EU are trying to wrap up the FTA talks substantially by the year-end. An FTA with the EU will help India diversify its exports more as it tries to find markets for its exports hit by US tariffs.

Title   : CNH chief says US tariffs on India mark ‘pause’ in trade talks 
Source  : www.thehindubusinessline.com

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerrit Marx, the global chief executive of CNH Industrial, has said the 50 per cent tariffs imposed by the US on Indian products represent a pause in negotiations as both sides reassess their positions, rather than the outcome of any formal trade agreement.
“The 50 per cent that are imposed on India right now is not a result of negotiations,” Marx told reporters. “It’s a kind of a pause on a discussion where both sides, I think, are currently reassessing their options. This is not even a result. So, I think we will see in a couple of months, I hope still this year, maybe then early next year, a deal between India and the US that will be materially different from 50 per cent tariffs.”
Marx, who heads the maker of New Holland Agriculture tractors and construction equipment, said the company was currently shipping from India to the US only when absolutely necessary, as higher duties made most consignments uneconomical.
Enough stock
“We have enough stock of locally made Indian utilities and compacts from our Korean partners in the country. So, we can easily hold for a couple of months and see where these negotiations are going,” he said. “There is not pretty large amounts of impact from the tariffs at this point in time. I think in relative terms, we are probably impacted in a similar fashion to others. But we are working around those points and we are looking at ways to counter it with, let’s say, supply chain moves or production moves.”
He added that the company was not considering shifting production in response to tariffs. “Maybe they look different again eight months from now. So that’s not a point in time when you want to make big decisions and try to play hero for a day. I just hold my line, I just focus, and I manage in the day-to-day.”
Market share
CNH produced about 51,000 tractors in India last year, selling roughly 37,000 units in the domestic market. In August, it retailed 3,900 units and currently holds a 4.5 per cent market share. Marx said the company aims to double that share by 2030.
India’s tractor market is led by Mahindra & Mahindra, with a market share of more than 23 per cent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A technical trial focused on commercialisation of e-trucks, which was started on the World EV Day last year from Chennai, reached its rollout milestone on Tuesday with an impressive outcome of deploying 1000 e-trucks at various freight routes across India.
Technology piloting agency Ease of Doing Business had initiated the commercial prototyping of e-trucks in participation along with electric truck fleet operator Transvolt Mobility.
On the World EV Day last year, they brought together stakeholders to accelerate deployment, including incentivising, accelerating and overall financing for e-trucks.
NHEV and Transvolt Mobility signed a MoU on Tuesday to deploy these 1,000 e-trucks in New Delhi.
PM E-DRIVE has brought electric trucks under its incentive coverage. The scale and speed of private capital deployment in NHEV confirm that the policy trajectory is headed in the right direction. The overwhelming response from various Zero Emission Trucking (ZET) stakeholders is encouraging, underscored Sudhendu J Sinha, Advisor at NITI Aayog.
Recent Public-Private Partnership (PPP) deployments, such as the $7 million Viability Gap Funding (VGF) in NHEV and the $20 million equity investment from IFC in Transvolt Mobility, are expected to further accelerate nationwide adoption of electric Heavy Duty Vehicles (HDVs) and the transition of surface transport to clean, cutting-edge, zero-emission solutions, he added.
Ease of Doing Business has already concluded the commercial prototyping of electric cars and buses on the Delhi-Agra (2020) and Delhi-Jaipur (2022) electric highways under the government’s e-mobility initiative—National Highways for Electric Vehicles (NHEV).
e-Trucks
On August 1, 2025, the final piece was introduced as a financing instrument worth ₹500 crore, which was opened to collect expression of interest (EoI) from stakeholders seeking blended climate financing for e-truck deployment.
Last month, Ease of Doing Business had said that ₹500 crore is projected to finance the deployment of a maximum of 720-810 e-trucks under a credit outlay to meet Viability Gap Funding (VGF).
“This deployment, coming out of a comprehensive technical and commercial exercise, is extending Ease of Doing Business on both technical interoperability and climate financing fronts, emphasised Abhijeet Sinha, National Program Director at Ease of Doing Business.
“E-truck manufacturers, and infra & fleet operators are determined to reduce electric truck costs from ₹1.25 crore to ₹90 lakh to offer around 10 per cent lesser logistics cost in comparison to diesel fleet operators,” he added.
This batch of 1,000 e-trucks, to be owned and operated by Transvolt Mobility, will also be deployed in construction projects, mines, shipyards and both dry/ wet ports, said Siddesh Rai, Vice President at Transvolt Mobility.
They will also connect multimodal logistics Gati Shakti Cargo Terminals (GCTs) and road freight routes across India, which currently transport cement, automobiles, containers, coal, iron and steel, foodgrains, fertilisers, furniture and petroleum products, he added.
“Now, with NHEV, we are getting the opportunity to offer quick trials and deployments to potential public PSUs, corporations, mines & ports interested in leasing heavy-duty electric trucks, dumpers & tippers,” noted Rai.
The announcement to deploy 1,000 e-trucks’ comes after the auto sector witnessed almost double digit e-truck sales in August 2025, following Centre’s ₹500 crore incentive scheme, which was introduced in July 2025.
The Ministry of Heavy Industries’ had notified guidelines for claiming e-truck incentives under the PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM E-DRIVE) scheme to incentivise e-truck adoption with an upfront capital subsidy of ₹2.7-9.3 lakhs for the purchase of each truck.

Title   : Patanjali Foods 2:1 bonus issue: Last opportunity to buy shares for eligibility today 
Source  : economictimes.indiatimes.com
Published: 2025-09-10T02:42:47
Fetched : 2025-09-10T04:01:46.422579
URL     : https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/patanjali-foods-21-bonus-issue-last-opportunity-to-buy-shares-for-eligibility-today/articleshow/123798241.cms
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patanjali Foods recently declared a 2:1 bonus issue, meaning that shareholders will receive two additional equity shares for every one share held as on the record date. This corporate action is intended to reward existing shareholders by increasing their shareholding proportionately without requiring additional investment.
The record date of September 11 implies that investors must own the shares of Patanjali Foods by the end of today’s trading session to be eligible. In the Indian stock market, trades are settled on a T+1 basis (trade date plus one business day). Therefore, only those investors whose purchase transactions are completed by today will have their names reflected in the company’s books as shareholders on the record date.
Bonus shares are issued by companies by capitalizing their free reserves, securities premium, or retained earnings. While the overall value of an investor’s holding does not change immediately after the bonus issuance, the number of shares held increases, and the share price typically adjusts in proportion to the bonus ratio.
Investors who miss today’s deadline will not be eligible for the bonus issue and will have to wait for any future such announcements by the company. The bonus shares, once allotted, will be credited directly into the demat accounts of eligible shareholders in due course.
On Tuesday, the shares of Patanjali Foods closed flat at Rs 1,802 on the BSE.

Title   : Silver shines as ETF flows, central banks buying boost rally
Source  : www.thehindubusinessline.com

URL     : https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/commodities/silver-shines-as-etf-flows-central-banks-buying-boost-rally/article70030748.ece
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Silver’s strong run in 2025 is getting fresh legs from heavy inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and renewed official sector interest. Global silver ETFs and ETPs have attracted robust investments this year, including a $40 million allocation by the Saudi Central Bank. Russia has also announced plans to purchase $535 million worth of silver for its state reserves over the next three years.
On the domestic front, silver imports crossed 3,000 tonnes in the first half of 2025, underlining demand momentum. The flows come on top of about 40 per cent year-to-date rally in prices, supported by both haven demand amid geopolitical tensions and rising industrial usage, says Motilal Oswal Financial Services report on Silver Quarterly Perspective (Q3 2025).
The white metal’s dual identity as both a monetary and industrial metal is reflected in its high correlation with gold (81 per cent) and copper (75 per cent) this year. Industrial demand is set to account for nearly 60 per cent of global production in 2025, led by photovoltaic (PV) modules, where China alone exported 127 GW in the first half. Jewellery demand, however, is forecast to decline 6 per cent this year.
5% rise in recycling
Market fundamentals remain tight, with the silver supply/balance expected to stay in deficit for a fifth straight year. This is despite a 5 per cent rise in recycling. Macro cues are also turning supportive for the metal – the IMF has upgraded its global growth outlook, inflation is trending near central bank targets, and expectations are building for a 25 basis point US rate cut in September.
Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL) continues to hold a bullish medium- to long-term stance on silver. Having achieved earlier targets of ₹1,11,111 and ₹1,25,000, the brokerage now sees the precious metal heading towards ₹1,35,000 and eventually ₹1,50,000 on the domestic front, assuming USD-INR at 88.5. On COMEX, silver could test $45 and then $50.
Long-term support levels are placed near ₹1,04,000-1,08,000, with MOFSL recommending accumulation on dips over a 12-15 month horizon.

The Global Fintech Fest that kicks off on October 7 this year will see Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sharing the stage with the UK’s PM Keir Starmer.

This year GFF is being held in the midst of tariff-induced turmoil in the global economy, while India is at the receiving end of 50 per cent duty imposed on its goods entering the US.
Free trade agreement
India has already signed a free trade agreement with the UK in July, which will significantly lower trade barriers between the two countries.
In a curtain raiser for the event, it was revealed that the event, which usually attracts large crowds, will be attended by 500-odd investors from across the globe, while over 5000 corporates are expected to be at the event, including fintechs from India and overseas.
The event is also a platform for start-up founders to connect with potential investors and Gaurav Chopra, Executive Director, Payments Council of India said while deal closures may not actually conclude, conversations were likely to take place. Last year, for instance, deals worth about $2-3 billion that concluded, had their origins in the event.

Other attendees include Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Deutsche Bundesbank of the Federal Republic of Germany, Banque de France, and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA.

Title   : Sula bets big on wine tourism with new resort; tourism to contribute one-fifth to revenues by FY26 end

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sula is deepening its bet on wine tourism with the launch of ‘Haven by Sula’, a new 30-room resort opening this month in Nashik, Rajeev Samant, the CEO of Sula Vineyards, said. Tourism already contributes about ₹100 crore to Sula’s ₹600 crore turnover, and is expected to account for nearly one-fifth of revenues by the end of FY26.
“Over the past year, the wine tourism business has been growing faster than our overall business, which was mostly flat. Wine tourism is crucial for the development of wine consumption and appreciation in India, and for any producer to survive and succeed,” Samant shared.
In Q1 FY26, the wine player’s revenue from operations fell 7.9 per cent y-o-y to ₹118.3 crore. However, Sula’s wine tourism reported yet another record quarter with revenue standing at ₹13.7 crore, up 22 per cent y-o-y. Alongside, the wine tourism business has scaled rapidly, growing at a 35 per cent CAGR between FY21 and FY25.
4 tasting rooms
The CEO said Sula will open a new tasting room at its Domaine Sula property near Bengaluru by the end of Q2, complementing the Dindori Tasting Room launched in July 2025. This will take the company’s tally to around four tasting rooms, including its flagship near The Source, and the one at York.
With five wineries in Maharashtra and Karnataka, Sula is distributing over a million cases across India annually, according to its quarterly earnings report. Its Nashik campus today hosts over 330,000 visitors annually.
Sula Vineyards has emerged as India’s largest wine company over the years, commanding over 50 per cent of the domestic wine market. The CEO highlighted that the company will remain focused on increasing its domestic market share.
“Our number one priority is increasing domestic consumption of wine and growing the market in India. Within the country, metro and tier-1 cities are where the action is for wine. Tier-2 markets are evolving slowly and will take more time to grow. These cities will first shift towards premium branded spirits from local, cheaper brands, and then we expect to see a rise in female drinkers,” Samant noted.
Wine consumption in India is currently concentrated in about 15 cities — including Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune— where the company is focusing its efforts.
“For example, Chennai and Kolkata are underdeveloped in terms of wine consumption. Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru, and NCR are a little ahead, while Hyderabad is growing very fast. We have our hands full with these places, and it’s easier to do activations here rather than going out into the Talukas or districts. For the next 3-4 years, our focus will be on metro and tier one cities,” he said.

In a stock exchange filing, Yes Bank confirmed that the RBI has approved the proposed changes that allow for the nomination of two directors by SMBC and one nominee director by SBI to the bank’s board.

The bank had earlier disclosed the proposed amendments on June 3, 2025, and provided further clarity through documents shared with the exchanges, including outcome resolutions and agreement filings.
However, the bank clarified that the final consummation of the transactions under the SPA remains subject to customary conditions precedent, as outlined in the May 9 agreement.
On Tuesday, the shares of Yes Bank closed nearly 1% higher at Rs 20.35 on the BSE.

Title   : Kotak Mahindra Bank shares in focus as Sumitomo Mitsui set to sell 1.65% stake

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The sale will be executed at a floor price of Rs 1,880 per share, representing a discount of around 4% to Kotak’s last closing price, according to a CNBC-TV18 report.
As per the shareholding pattern for the June 2024 quarter, Sumitomo Mitsui held a 1.65% stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank. Post-transaction, this stake will move into public hands. Promoter holding currently stands at 25.88%, while public shareholding is at 74%.
The transaction is expected to create short-term supply pressure on the stock, but analysts remain constructive on Kotak’s long-term prospects. Brokerage firm Axis Securities has reiterated a BUY call with a target price of Rs 2,178, implying a potential upside of nearly 10% from current levels.
Despite the stake sale, Kotak’s fundamentals remain strong. The bank is among India’s largest and most diversified private lenders, with a strong presence in retail, SME, corporate, and investment banking. It operates a network of 5,440 branches and 2,927 ATMs across the country, offering a wide range of financial products and services.
Brokerages believe the block deal does not alter the bank’s long-term investment case. Axis Securities noted that pressures in asset quality, particularly in microfinance and unsecured lending, appear to have peaked. Growth is expected to accelerate in retail-focused segments such as personal loans, credit cards, and mid-market corporate lending.
Margins, which had contracted due to rate actions, are expected to stabilise at 4.7% in FY26 and improve to 5% by FY28. Credit growth is projected to clock a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17% between FY25 and FY28, supported by higher-yielding unsecured loans and easing deposit costs.
Sumitomo Mitsui has been a long-term strategic investor in Kotak and has collaborated with the bank on various financial services initiatives in the past.

Title   : Vodafone Idea shares in focus as telco files fresh plea Supreme Court over AGR dues

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The company has requested the apex court to quash the demands and direct the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to reassess them under updated verification guidelines.
In its petition, Vodafone Idea has urged the court to instruct the DoT to conduct a comprehensive reassessment of AGR dues based on the ‘Deduction Verification Guidelines’ issued on February 3, 2020.
The telco is challenging what it says are arithmetical and duplication-related errors in the earlier calculations, which formed the basis of the government’s demand.
This legal development could inject volatility into the stock, as investors assess the implications for the company’s long-term liabilities and repayment schedule. Vodafone Idea’s total AGR dues stand as part of the Rs 93,520 crore burden shared among telecom operators, stemming from a long-standing dispute over the definition of revenue used to calculate statutory dues.
The company’s plea comes after previous re-evaluation attempts were rejected.
The Supreme Court had, in July 2021, dismissed similar applications from telecom players, including Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel. The top court held its earlier ruling from 2020 as final, directing telecom operators to clear their dues over a 10-year period ending March 2031.
As per that 2020 order, telcos were to pay 10% of the total dues by March 31, 2021, with the remainder to be paid in annual instalments. The court had categorically stated that no further dispute or reassessment should be entertained regarding the dues assessed by the DoT.

Vodafone Idea has now sought an early hearing on its fresh petition, filed on September 8, in a bid to reopen the matter based on updated procedural guidelines. The market will be closely watching for any judicial response or investor sentiment around the company’s move, which could have a material impact on its balance sheet if relief is granted.

Title   : Vodafone Idea moves Supreme Court against additional  ₹9,450 cr AGR dues demand
Source  : www.livemint.com

Vodafone Idea moves Supreme Court against additional ₹9,450 cr AGR dues demand
Vodafone Idea has moved the Supreme Court challenging DoT’s fresh ₹9,450 crore demand in dues towards adjusted gross revenue, arguing it violates a 2020 ruling.
Vodafone Idea Ltd has filed a fresh writ petition in the Supreme Court challenging an additional demand of ₹9,450 crore by the Union government towards adjusted gross revenue dues.
The Supreme Court had on 18 March 2020 locked Vodafone Idea’s AGR dues till 2016-17 based on calculations by the department of telecommunications (DoT), adding that no self-assessment or re-assessment of the dues would be permitted.
But DoT has now sought additional payments for up to 2018-19, Vodafone Idea said in its petition dated 8 September, which Mint has seen.
Of the ₹9,450 crore, the additional demand raised by DoT from Idea Group and Vodafone Idea (post merger in August 2018) was at ₹2,774 crore, while the demand against Vodafone Group (pre-merger) was ₹6,675 crore, according to the petition.
The beleaguered telecom operator owes about ₹83,400 crore in AGR dues to the government, with annual payments of ₹18,000 crore beginning in March. Overall, Vodafone Idea’s total dues to the government stand at around ₹2 trillion, including penalty and interest.
“A sum of approx ₹9,450 Crores has been computed by the DoT which is to be considered with reference to the scheduled payment due on 31 March 2026. In this sum of approx ₹9,450 crores, the majority amount of approx ₹5,606 crores (as on 31.03.2025) is for the period up to FY 2016-17 which has already been crystalized by this Hon'ble Court," Vodafone Idea said in its petition.
The telecom operator requested the Supreme Court to quash DoT’s additional demands for AGR payments up to FY17, and to order a comprehensive reassessment and reconciliation of all AGR dues for that period. Adjusted gross revenue represents a portion of a telecom company's gross revenue that’s considered towards regulatory payments.
The substantial liability created by the AGR demand threatened the company’s existence and “the livelihood of thousands of employees working directly or indirectly" with it, Vodafone Idea said in its petition. The company has nearly 198 million users and more than 18,000 employees.
‘Erroneous math’
According to Vodafone Idea’s latest petition, DoT’s additional demand pertains to dues involving licence fees (calculated as a percentage of AGR). If payment demands towards additional spectrum usage charges for the period up to FY17 are also considered, the amount is about ₹6,800 crore as on 31 March 2025, it said.
In a letter dated 13 August to Vodafone Idea, DoT said revised or updated outstanding licence fee dues up to FY19 had not been tabulated in the Supreme Court’s order dated 1 September 2020.
The department told the telecom operator that the licence fee dues were calculated with interest and interest on penalty up to October 2019, and updated up to 31 March 2025 with interest calculated at a rate of 8% per annum. Mint has seen a copy of the letter.
In response, Vodafone Idea in a letter dated 28 August to DoT said that it cannot raise any revised or updated AGR demand for the period up to FY17 without seeking clarification on the Supreme Court’s September 2020 judgement.
The company informed DoT that it was not admitting any liability other than periodic interest on ₹58,254 crore. It also called out DoT’s calculation on the licence fee dues for FY18 and FY19 as erroneous.
The government owns nearly 49% stake in Vodafone Idea after converting nearly ₹53,083 crore of dues into equity in two tranches—in February 2023 and April 2025.
In April, Bharti Airtel Ltd urged DoT to convert its AGR dues of about ₹40,000 crore into equity, which would give the government a 3-4% stake in India’s second-largest telecom operator. The company said in August it was ready to pay the dues but that it expected the government to extend it the same relief given to any other telecom operator.
Quest for survival
In 2019, the Supreme Court ruled that Vodafone Idea and its peers needed to pay statutory liabilities on AGR, including non-telecom revenue, to the government. But there were massive gaps between the telecom department’s calculations and self-assessed dues by telecom operators.
For Vodafone Idea, DoT calculated total dues at ₹58,254 crore against the company’s estimate of ₹21,500 crore.
In August 2024, the Supreme Court rejected curative petitions filed by Vodafone Idea and other operators seeking relief in the apex court’s 2019 ruling.
In May this year, the Supreme Court rejected Vodafone Idea’s plea for a waiver on ₹45,000 crore in interest and penalties on its ₹83,400 crore AGR dues. A four-year moratorium on these payouts ends this month.
“Although, it has been the Petitioner’s (Vodafone Idea) case itself that the amount of ₹58,254 crores is erroneous and riddled with clerical and arithmetical errors. However, in light of the directions passed by this Hon'ble Court, petitioner is unable to seek rectification of the demands," the company said in its latest petition.
According to Vodafone Idea, the directions passed by the Supreme Court also restrain the government from raising additional AGR dues for the period till FY17 over and above the amount of ₹58,254 crore.
Vodafone Idea has also requested the government for relief on its AGR dues. Without such relief, the company told the government and the Supreme Court earlier that it won’t be able to survive beyond the current financial year.
“It is important to note that this payment of approx. ₹18,000 crores which has to be paid on a yearly basis for the next 6 years, is far in excess of the Company’s operational cash generation capacity each year," the company told the Supreme Court in May.
Vodafone Idea’s annual operational cash generation was in the range of ₹8,400-9,200 crore the previous three financial years, it had said.
“Our request to the government has been that let us resolve this (AGR issue) earlier than before the deadline of March so that banks get clarity and we can proceed with bank funding," Akshaya Moondra said during his final earnings call as chief executive of Vodafone Idea on 18 August.

Gifting companies plan to hitch growth ride with Swiggy, Blinkit
Swiggy has launched 'Giftables', its instant gifting service in Bengaluru, taking cue from bigger peer Blinkit to capture festive demand, enhancing collaboration with gifting firms like FNP and Archies, which see quick commerce as a beneficial sales channel.
BENGALURU : Swiggy Ltd has entered the gifting space with a new segment ‘Giftables’, following a similar move by its larger rival Blinkit. The push into instant gifting is being viewed as a fresh growth opportunity, one that could also lift demand for traditional yet loss-making incumbents such as Archie's, Ferns N Petals (FNP), and IGP (Indian Gifts Portal).
The timing of the launch appears strategic with the upcoming festivals set to charge up the gifting space and impulse buying become more the norm.
FNP and Archies do not see Swiggy and Blinkit as rivals. Instead, they call quick-commerce a new sales channel that has already become meaningful, Both brands say platforms such as Instamart and Blinkit have helped them expand reach, with FNP doubling its quick commerce sales every quarter and Archies now generating about a fifth of its revenue from such tie-ups.
FNP rides quick commerce wave
“We are an omnichannel brand, and Swiggy is a key partner for distribution," said Avi Kumar, chief marketing officer at FNP. "While our own website remains the largest contributor, quick commerce has clearly emerged as the fastest-growing sales channel. Giftables will create further synergies between the brands and open new avenues for consumers," he said.
FNP's sales through quick-commerce platforms have been doubling each quarter, especially for cakes, flowers, and gift hampers, he said.
The Delhi-based gifting company, which has been in the business for over three decades, raised ₹200 crore in 2022 from Lighthouse India Fund III at a valuation of ₹2,400 crore. It specializes in cakes, flowers, chocolates, personalized gifts, lifestyle products, and corporate gifting solutions.
In FY24, FNP E Retail Pvt Ltd reported revenue of ₹256.3 crore, up from ₹210.9 crore in FY23. Its losses narrowed to ₹18.3 crore from ₹36.4 crore the year before, according to the filings with the ministry of corporate affairs. The company is yet to file its financials for FY25.
Archies embraces omnichannel approach
Archies Ltd, which was a rage amongst teenagers around the turn of the millennium, sees quick commerce as an important sales avenue. Archies gets 60% of its revenues from retail stores, 20% from quick commerce and 2-3% from e-commerce/website and the remaining about 17-18% from exports.
“Quick commerce is not a threat but a partner. It helps us with logistics and last-mile delivery, and gives us a capex-light way to expand beyond our stores," said Hanisha Gandhi, executive director at Archies. "That said, retail will always remain our backbone."
Gandhi said reliance on marketplaces and delivery partners does come with risks. “We haven’t yet been charged any listing or advertising fees by these platforms, but there is always that risk. That’s why we’re working on revamping our brand image, differentiating products across channels, and bringing more premium offerings back into our retail stores," she said.
Archies reported a revenue of ₹69.7 crore as of FY25, down from ₹80.1 crore last fiscal year. The company's net loss for FY25 narrowed to ₹1.5 crore from Rs. 8.21 crore last fiscal year according to the company’s FY25 annual report filed with the Bombay Stock Exchange. The Archies Ltd stock, which traded at upwards of ₹1,300 at a point in 1999, closed at 18.08 on Tuesday, with a market capitalisation of ₹61.07 crore.
The company is in the process of revamping its stores and product lines by March to appeal to younger consumers, even as competition rises from social media-driven labels.
“Instagram and influencer-led gifting brands have eaten into sales, especially among younger consumers. But Archie's has the advantage of trust and legacy; we’ve been in this business for over three decades. Convenience matters, but so does reliability when it comes to emotions," Gandhi said.
Limitations of quick commerce
Join Ventures Private Ltd, which runs gifting platform IGP and flower delivery platform Interflora India, posted revenue growth of 34.45% to ₹160 crore in FY24, though it remained loss-making with a narrowed net loss of ₹9.9 crore according to filings with the ministry of corporate affairs. The company is yet to file its FY25 financials.
“Quick commerce is helping expand the overall market rather than eating into our share," said Tarun Joshi, founder and CEO of IGP. “But for categories like personalized gifts and premium hampers, customers still turn to dedicated gifting platforms like ours, where discovery and curation are far deeper than a 10-minute delivery app."
He said that while collaborations with q-commerce firms are welcome, there are limitations. “Impulse-led categories such as flowers and cakes work well on q-commerce, but the real differentiation in gifting is around personalization, premium experiences, and creating memorable moments. That’s not something q-commerce has cracked yet."
Join Ventures, the parent company of IGP raised $33.5 million in 2022 through two rounds of funding at an undisclosed valuation from investors including MO Alternate Investment Advisors and Convivialité Ventures.
A spokesperson for Eternal, which owns Blinkit that has been in the gifting space since February 2024, did not respond to requests for comments. Blinkit has been in the gifting space since February 2024. A spokesperson for Swiggy also did not respond to Mint's queries on its collaboration or competition with existing gifting platforms.
Instant gifting meets AI
"We believe Swiggy is uniquely positioned to make gifting effortless for Indians, thanks to the combined power of our food delivery and Instamart offerings," the Swiggy spokesperson said in an email. The company pegs the total addressable market at $2.5-3.0 billion, with casual, everyday gifting forming a significant share of this opportunity.
Giftables is Swiggy’s new instant gifting service, launched in Bengaluru this month. It allows users to curate and personalize gift bundles featuring cakes, flowers, chocolates, and toys, as well as lifestyle products and electronics, and have them delivered within an hour through the company’s app.
The platform also features artificial intelligence-powered recommendations to help shoppers pick gifts based on the occasion or the recipient’s preferences. Swiggy plans to roll out Giftables to other metros such as Delhi and Mumbai ahead of festivals such as Diwali that will be celebrated mid-October, aiming to make itself a one-stop destination for both last-minute and planned gifting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Bloomberg) -- Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA has secured a majority stake in Mediobanca SpA, cementing a once-unthinkable €16 billion takeover that’s set to reshape Italian finance.
Mediobanca investors have tendered 62.3% of the shares to Monte Paschi, according to a filing on Monday that confirmed an earlier Bloomberg News report. That will give Monte Paschi a majority stake once it has formally acquired those shares.
The deal, worth almost €16 billion ($18.8 billion) at Monday’s market close, is set to create Italy’s third-largest lender by assets. It brings to fruition a long-held ambition of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni to establish a new large bank that can rival Intesa Sanpaolo SpA and UniCredit SpA.
If completed, it will also mark the first large-scale deal since a wave of M&A across the Italian financial sector started about a year ago. Several smaller takeovers have since gone through while UniCredit dropped its pursuit of Banco BPM SpA.
The Mediobanca acquisition “creates a new competitive force” that will rank “among the leaders in the Italian banking sector,” Monte Paschi said in a press release on Monday.
The takeover of Italy’s largest independent investment bank caps a stunning turnaround for Monte Paschi, considered to be the world’s oldest bank still in operation.
Founded in 1472, Monte Paschi only recently emerged from a deep restructuring lasting over a decade. An ill-timed takeover just before the financial crisis years from 2008 marked the beginning of the bank’s troubles, culminating in its nationalization in 2017.
Along the way, investors injected more than €14 billion in fresh funds. That added to about €7 billion in capital provided by various Italian administrations.
Deep Restructuring
But since Chief Executive Officer Luigi Lovaglio took over in 2022, rising interest rates and his deep restructuring have boosted profitability and lifted the share price, allowing Rome to sell down its stake.
The rising stock has also given Monte Paschi the currency to launch the takeover bid for Mediobanca, a competitor with a market valuation that’s about 70% higher.
Monte Paschi earlier this month improved its offer by adding a cash, and it lowered the minimum acceptance threshold to 35%.
The new offer valued Mediobanca at €19.56 per share at Monday’s market close, equivalent to a market capitalization of about €16 billion. That compared with a market price of €19.48 per share.
Monte Paschi will benefit from expanded operations in asset gathering, private banking, investment banking and insurance, Lovaglio has said. His lender would represent about 60% of the combined entity in terms of customer loans and clients assets.
Mediobanca’s leadership has repeatedly rejected the approach, saying it destroys value and shareholders are better off if the firm stays independent.
Monte Paschi’s holding may further increase as the tender offer, which ended at Monday’s market close, will reopen from Sept. 16 through Sept. 22. The Siena-based lender has committed itself to buying the tendered shares.
While Monte Paschi has previously said it considers the transaction as successful if it obtains at least 35% in Mediobanca, an outright majority will give it more influence. It will also allow the lender to consolidate Mediobanca and boost capital by speeding up the use of as much as €2.9 billion in deferred tax assets.
In the press release on Monday, Monte Paschi said that not all conditions of its offer have been met yet.
Closing a Chapter
The deal closes the chapter on Mediobanca’s role as Italy’s largest independent listed investment bank and will likely mark the end of Alberto Nagel’s time at the top of the firm. He joined the bank in 1991 and took his current role in 2008, making him one of the longest serving CEOs in European banking.
Nagel is preparing to resign along with the rest of the lender’s board as Monte Paschi is nearing control of the rival, Bloomberg News has reported. There’s no final decision by Nagel or the board, and the situation could yet change, people familiar with the matter have said.

Title   : JPMorgan, Fifth Third Among Banks Facing Losses Tied to Tricolor
Source  : www.livemint.com

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co., Fifth Third Bancorp and Barclays Plc are among banks bracing for potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in combined losses from loans tied to subprime auto lender Tricolor Holdings, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
Fifth Third said in a regulatory filing Tuesday that it faced an impairment charge of up to $200 million after discovering alleged fraudulent activity at a commercial borrower, which it didn’t identify. The bank said it was working with law enforcement authorities.
The lenders are looking into whether collateral for warehouse lines was double-pledged, said some of the people, who asked not to be identified because of the potential for a probe by authorities.
Tricolor focuses on lending to borrowers across the US southwest who typically have poor or no credit scores. It funds the loans at least in part by packaging them into asset-backed securities to sell to bond investors, most recently selling a $217 million bond in early June, an offering led by JPMorgan and Barclays.
JPMorgan, Barclays and Fifth Third have been warehouse lenders to Tricolor, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
Daniel Chu, Tricolor’s chief executive officer, and other executives at the company didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment. Representatives for Fifth Third, JPMorgan and Barclays declined to comment.
There’s an outstanding balance of about $200 million on Fifth Third’s asset-backed finance loan in question, according to the filing. Fifth Third expects to take a non-cash charge of $170 million to $200 million in the third quarter related to that loan.
Such loans are typically backed by streams of contractual cash flows tied to a defined pool of assets, such as consumer loans or mortgages.
Tricolor’s asset-backed securities were trading lower this week after Spanish language news outlet Univision reported that the company has furloughed most of its staff.
Shares of Fifth Third dropped 2.5% to $44.30 in late trading at 5:47 p.m. in New York.

Title   : Titan’s Helios looks to double revenue to ₹2,000 crore in three years

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multi-brand watch retail chain Helios, part of Titan Company, is looking to double its revenue to ₹2,000 crore in the next three years, backed by store expansion, customer acquisition and adding more brands to its portfolio.
Revenue for the multi-brand retailer of watches last fiscal stood at around ₹700 crore. “This [financial] year we are targeting ₹1,000 crore. In the next three years, we will double up our business,” Rahul Shukla, Vice-President & CSMO, watches division, Titan Company, told businessline.
“We do have an ambition that Helios as a chain of stores will probably become a ₹2,000 crore business over the next three years. It will largely be driven by expansion of footprint, expansion of the brand offering and the expansion of the consumer base,” said Shukla. Its revenue witnessed around 35 per cent CAGR over the last three years.
‘To add stores’
Helios, India’s largest retail chain of accessible luxury watches, currently has around 280 stores spread across 100 cities. “Our plan is to add roughly 50 stores nationally this financial year. We have already launched in this financial year around 20 odd stores,” added Shukla.
The retailer has a portfolio of in-house brands, licensed brands and Swiss brands, among others.
“There is a lot of consumer interest and desire, especially among the young and new-age consumers, who are very discerning and extremely exposed to international brands and trends. So, for those consumers, who want to buy international brands, this is the one-stop-shop where they can actually have accessible luxury which they can don on their wrist,” said Shukla.
The retail chain has been witnessing growth from both metro cities as well as Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. “There are 300 million consumers in India who actually have a surplus discretionary income and, hence, they are the ones who actually drive consumption. Of these 300 million consumers, around 50 per cent of them are actually not in metros,” said Shukla.
GST rates
There has been no change in GST rates as far as watches are concerned. Watches attract 18 per cent GST.
Shukla said the GST reforms will increase the discretionary income available with consumers, and a rising consumption tide with the spillover effect is also expected to lift all categories and segments. “That is why we are looking forward to a very robust season...we are seeing a lot of euphoria amongst the consumers, a feel good factor,” he said.
“We are quite upbeat about the festival season. And the first few signs from Ganesh Chaturthi onwards are quite visible. We are seeing a pretty robust uptake in the performance of our stores,” Shukla added.

Title   : GM Delays Cuts at Canada Plant Threatened by Trump’s Tariffs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General Motors Co. is pausing plans to eliminate a shift at its lone pickup-truck assembly plant in Canada, offering a temporary reprieve for hundreds of workers affected by President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
The Detroit-based automaker will keep three shifts at its factory in Oshawa, Ontario, until at least Jan. 30, according to Unifor, which represents workers at the plant that makes the Chevrolet Silverado.
In May, GM said it would cut one shift at the plant “in light of forecasted demand and the evolving trade environment,” and had planned to make the reduction this fall. The company has announced plans to boost Silverado output at a factory in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
The union also said Stellantis NV is bringing back a third shift at its factory in Windsor, Ontario, right across the border from Detroit, in the first quarter of 2026. Production was reduced at that plant, which makes Chrysler minivans and the Dodge Charger Daytona, shortly after Trump imposed tariffs on foreign-made automobiles.
Prime Minister Mark Carney retaliated by placing similar levies on US-made cars and light trucks — but soon after, his government said auto companies would be able to apply for tariff relief as long as they continued producing vehicles and investing in Canada.
Unifor has been pressuring Carney not to sign a trade deal with Trump that would enshrine tariffs on goods made in Canada.
“Auto workers still face a highly precarious situation in Oshawa as well as other auto communities, but it does show that the work our union is doing and the message our members are sending to decision-makers is making a difference,” Unifor National President Lana Payne said in a statement.

Title   : Sensex jumps over 300 pts, Nifty50 tops 24,950 after Trump revives trade talks with India

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The S&P BSE Sensex rose 321 points, or 0.4%, to 81,422.34 at the open, while the NSE Nifty 50 advanced 95.85 points, or 0.39%, to 24,964.45. At 9:43 AM, Sensex traded 471 or 0.58% higher at 81,573, whereas Nifty50 rose 144 pts or 0.58% to 25,012.
On the 30-stock Sensex pack, IT majors HCL Technologies, TCS, Tech Mahindra, L&T and Infosys were among the top performers, rising between 1% and 2%.
On a sectoral basis, gains were led by financials and IT shares, with the sectoral indices up 0.5% and 2%, respectively.
Broader markets also participated in the rally, with both small-cap and mid-cap indices advancing 0.5%.
The Nifty has climbed about 1.2% over the past five sessions but remains 5.4% below its record high set on September 27, 2024.
Investors, however, were reminded of simmering geopolitical risks after Donald Trump pressed European Union officials to impose 100% tariffs on China and India as part of a broader effort to pressure Russia, Reuters reported, citing a U.S. official and an EU diplomat.
At the same time, Trump struck a conciliatory note on bilateral ties, saying the U.S. was looking to expand trade with India amid ongoing talks to lower barriers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he looked forward to speaking with Trump and that both sides were working to wrap up negotiations quickly.
Expert views
Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, said that while “a major positive for the market today comes from President Trump’s initiative to improve India-U.S. relations and PM Modi’s positive response,” investors should be cautious. “From past experience the market should judge President Trump by his actions and not words,” he said.Vijayakumar noted that stretched valuations, particularly in the broader market, remain a hurdle for any meaningful rally, pointing out that India’s performance has lagged global peers, with the Nifty down 0.69% over the past year compared with gains of 51% and 31% in the Hang Seng and Kospi, respectively.
“Massive sustained selling by FIIs triggered by high Indian valuations is the principal reason for this underperformance,” he said, warning that overseas investors who shifted to other markets and profited “might do it again.” A reversal in this trend, he added, would depend on clearer signs of an earnings recovery.
Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Investments, said the Nifty continues to face resistance at the 24,870 mark. “Oscillators continue to point towards more upsides, which was a highlight of the previous day as well,” he noted, adding that the index could stretch higher with “the upside objective … extended to 25,400.”
However, he cautioned that “inability to push beyond the 25,100 region, or a direct fall below 24,700 could delay the maturity of upsides.”
Global Markets
Asian equities advanced on Wednesday, following Wall Street’s march to fresh records, while bond prices slipped as investors grew more confident that softening U.S. labour data would push the Federal Reserve to cut rates next week.Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.3%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.3% and Taiwan’s benchmark climbed 1.46% to an all-time high. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 0.5%, and mainland China’s blue-chip stocks edged up 0.2%.
Overnight in New York, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average all closed at record highs. Futures on the S&P 500 were up another 0.2% in early Asian trading.
Markets are treating a quarter-point rate cut by the Fed next Wednesday as a near certainty, while the CME Group’s FedWatch tool shows traders assigning a 7% chance of a larger half-point move, according to Reuters.
Gold rose 0.2% to $3,633 per ounce, after surging to a record $3,673.95 in the previous session.
FII/DII Tracker
On the institutional front, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) turned net buyers, purchasing equities worth a little over Rs 2,050 crore on September 9, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) were net buyers to the tune of Rs 83 crore.Crude Impact
Oil prices edged higher on Wednesday after Israel struck Hamas leadership in Qatar and President Donald Trump pressed Europe to levy tariffs on buyers of Russian crude, though concerns over a weak demand outlook limited the advance.Brent crude futures rose 35 cents, or 0.5%, to $66.74 a barrel in early Asian trading, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate added 36 cents, or 0.6%, to $62.99.
Rupee vs Dollar
The Indian rupee strengthened 5 paise to 88.10 against the U.S. dollar in early Wednesday trading, supported by foreign fund inflows and a softer greenback against major peers.The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six counterparts, slipped 0.45% to 97.90.

Title   : Amid iPhone 17 series launch, how US tariffs and Trump's ‘Make in US’ demand could jack Apple phone prices to  ₹3 lakh

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tech and electronics major Apple Inc. is set to launch its latest iPhone series 17 later today, along with a few accessories such as the AirPods Pro 3 and the Apple Watch Ultra 3.
However, there is another aspect looming. Notably, Apple's production line is largely based in China, and with Trump's tariff offensive, it leaned heavily on its India facilities to pick up demand. But that could change.
United States President Donald Trump is insistent that manufacturers start producing in the US, instead of China or India. For customers, especially, this could mean anything from a 40-50 per cent hike in cost to doubling and tripling of prices!
According to an AP report, both Trump and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have repeated what analysts feel is an “unrealistic demand.” Why? For one, it would take years to pull off, and even if achieved, the cost of a full US-made iPhone “would result in a doubling, or even a tripling, of the iPhone's current average price of about $1,000.”
In terms of pricing, the rumour mill is currently churning numbers closer to previous releases, with the base variant at $799 ( ₹79,900) and price hikes between $50-100 estimated for the Air, Pro, and Pro Max models, up to $1,249 (approximately ₹1,45,000).
But, tech analysts have warned that a “full” US-made iPhone could triple prices to $3,500 (around ₹3.1 lakh), CNN reported. Further, CNBC cited a Bank of America Securities official to note that the cost of labour difference between China and the US is dear — $40 ( ₹3,500) per unit in China vs $200 ( ₹17,219) per unit in the US — which could inflate the final cost of a US-made iPhone.
But, US manufacturing is still a long way away. The tariff impact on cost is still closer. According to a Reuters report, citing Rosenblatt Securities' estimates, if Apple chooses to pass down the tariffs to customers, the prices of all its models could jump by at least 43 per cent.
For the base model, that would be a jump from $799 to $1,142 (approximately ₹1,45,000), while the other models increase up to $2,300 (around ₹2 lakh) from $1,249.
Notably, at the recent launch of its new Pixel smartphone, Google did not increase prices. All eyes will thus be on the launch event today to see what route Apple takes.

Title   : Well-distributed monsoon so far across time and space: Swadhin Behera

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The monsoon this year in India has been particularly well-distributed than usual, both in time and space, says Dr Swadhin Behera, Director, Application Research Laboratory, at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (Jamstec), and a visiting professor at The University of Tokyo.
Rainfall covered most parts of the country with relatively few and shorter break periods, ensuring a more sustained supply of moisture, Behera remarked in an email interview with businessline. The only notable exception, as in recent past few years, has been the north-eastern region, that received comparatively less rainfall.
Dr Behera is currently a Union Fellow of the American Geophysical Union and has been recently awarded the VAIBHAV Fellowship by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India. Excerpts:
What does the future hold in terms of monsoonal rainfall for India?
Projections by the Sixth Coupled Inter-comparison Project (CMIP6) of the World Climate Research Programer suggest that future monsoons may actually bring more rainfall and greater variability to North-East India and the Himalayan foothills. What seems more likely is a future of erratic rainfall with fewer rainy days but more intense downpours, rather than a permanent drying trend over North-East India, for instance.
What do you think has been driving the surplus rainfall this year for country as a whole, even without a full-fledged La Niña?
Although a mature La Niña did not develop, the background state resembled a developing La Niña or La Niña Modoki, with warmer-than-normal conditions over the western Pacific. Associated large-scale circulation anomalies were generally favorable for enhanced monsoon rainfall over India.
At the same time, the Indian Ocean exhibited a negative IOD–like state that typically supports above-normal rainfall over North-West India, consistent with what we have observed this year. A persistent local cyclonic circulation over the region further amplified the rainfall in that region.
Another contributing factor could be the below-normal snow cover over Eurasia and the broader Northern Hemisphere in early 2025, which likely strengthened the monsoon circulation and helped sustain record rainfall, especially across northern India.
Finally, the warmer Bay of Bengal - particularly the head Bay region - could have favored the genesis of multiple monsoon low-pressure areas, which acted as efficient rain-bearing systems and transported moisture deep into the Indian subcontinent.
Do you visualise a situation in which rains could spill even into October, as in 2019?
Yes. The emerging La Niña/La Niña Modoki–like conditions in the Pacific, combined with the development of a negative IOD–like state in the Indian Ocean, are expected to persist into the coming months. This configuration tends to prolong monsoon activity and could indeed allow rainfall to spill into October, much like what we observed in 2019.
Why has North-West India been battered by record rainfall excess?
The negative IOD–like state in the Indian Ocean, combined with a persistent cyclonic circulation over the region, created favorable conditions for enhanced moisture transport and convergence. On top of this background, sub-seasonal drivers such as the MJO wave and Monsoon Intra-seasonal Oscillations were active during late August and early September.
Further, land-use changes - especially the expansion of irrigation - have modified local land–atmosphere feedback in recent decades. By enhancing evapotranspiration and surface moisture availability, irrigation can strengthen convection and monsoon rainfall, adding another layer of support for the record-breaking rainfall excess in the region.
Is it now a given that parts of East and North-East would remain perpetually rain-deficient for years to come?
Not necessarily. While the North-East has seen persistent rainfall deficits in recent decades, with below-average monsoon rains in most years since 2001, this does not mean the region will stay perpetually dry. The decline has been linked to shifts in large-scale circulation patterns under global warming, as well as regional drivers like the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.
How should we prepare ourselves for a persisting deficit in the North-East even as parts of West and North-West are witnessing normal to above-normal rainfall?
The region’s (North-East India) high mean rainfall is a positive point and could deter the persistent deficits seen in anomalies. But building resilience is essential as rainfall patterns shift. Scaling up rainwater harvesting, spring rejuvenation, and catchment conservation, combined with climate-resilient agriculture and diversified livelihoods, can buffer communities against variability.
The key is to adapt dynamically as rainfall changes in the future, using both traditional wisdom and modern policy support to ensure long-term water and food security.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Equity benchmark indices edged higher on Tuesday, led by IT stocks, buoyed by positive global cues and US interest rate cut prospects.
Sensex settled 314.02 pts or 0.39 per cent higher at 81,101.32. Nifty 50 closed higher for a fifth consecutive with 95.45 pts or 0.39 per cent increase at 24,868.60.
According to Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments, the market sentiment is likely to remain range-bound amid lingering uncertainties over global trade negotiations.
Siddhartha Khemka - Head of Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, also stressed that markets will remain range-bound, tracking developments around trade agreements and the outcome of the US Fed rate decision.
Ajit Mishra, SVP, Research, Religare Broking, maintained a positive yet cautious outlook on the Nifty and suggested closely tracking the performance of banking and IT majors for further cues.
The broader indices, midcap and smallcap rose marginally by 0.2 per cent and 0.3 per cent, respectively, in a narrow range for the second consecutive session.
On the sectoral front, Nifty IT rose nearly 3 per cent, aided by expectations of a potential US Fed rate cut, likely to benefit Indian IT exporters. Pharma, FMCG and metals also traded with modest gains. Market experts cite that auto stocks came under pressure due to profit booking after recent gains on GST rationalisation. Bank Nifty witnessed a lacklustre session.
Top gainers & losers today
Among the Sensex firms, Infosys climbed 5 per cent on the back of buyback proposal at its board meeting on September 11. Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Wipro, Adani Ports, Tech Mahindra, HCL Tech, TCS and Bajaj Finserv also emerged as major gainers.
On the flip side, Trent, Eternal, UltraTech Cement, Jio Financial, Titan and NTPC were among the laggards.
Meanwhile, Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives at SBI Securities, said that the advance-decline ratio remained flat, highlighting the lack of broad-based participation. Notably, 250 stocks from the Nifty 500 universe ended unchanged, underscoring the overall market indecisiveness.
A total of 3,106 stocks were traded on the National Stock Exchange, of which 1,486 stocks advanced, 1,514 declined, and 106 remained unchanged. About 108 stocks scaled to their 52-week high, while 43 stocks touched their 52-week low. About 93 stocks hit the upper circuit and 68 hit the lower circuit.
Mishra advised traders to continue with a “buy on dips” approach in the leading sectors while ensuring a favourable risk-reward balance.
Midcap & smallcap movers
Tata Communications, Glenmark, Tube Investments, Waaree Energies and Aditya Birla Fashion soared 2-4 per cent among the midcap index, while Supreme Industries, Paytm, Nykaa and IGL declined 2-3 per cent.
Under the smallcap segment, Affle 3i, ACE, RailTel, Titagarh and Amber surged 5-7 per cent, while Delhivery, Chambal Fertilizers, CreditAccess, Shyam Metalics and Anant Raj dropped close to 2 per cent.
Global markets
Asian markets, except Japan’s Nikkei 225 index and Shanghai’s SSE Composite index, settled in positive territory. Wall Street ended higher on Monday.
FIIs offloaded equities worth ₹2,170.35 crore on Monday, while DIIs bought stocks worth ₹3,014.30 crore, as per exchange data.
Brent crude rose 0.80 per cent to $66.55 a barrel.
On Monday, Sensex rose by 76.54 pts or 0.09 per cent to 80,787.30, and the Nifty 50 inched up by 32.15 pts or 0.13 per cent to 24,773.15.

Title   : Standard Bank Says Net Effect of East Africa Pipeline ‘Worth It’
Source  : www.livemint.com

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Bloomberg) -- Standard Bank Group Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Sim Tshabalala said the benefits of an oil pipeline the continent’s biggest lender is funding in East Africa outweigh the environmental risks.
TotalEnergies SE’s $5 billion 1,443-kilometer (897 mile) East African Crude Oil Pipeline being built to transport landlocked crude in Uganda to the coast for export has faced resistance from environmental groups that scrutinized potential lenders. Opponents have included Ugandan activists, European Parliament members and environmental groups.
“Yes, there are environmental costs, but these are being minimized, and the net effect is that the project is worth it, now and into the future, considering all the facts which include that East Africa has a right to economic development and that people need energy, they need income,” Tshabalala said at a conference in Johannesburg on Tuesday.
The bank chief’s position adds to a debate that pits African governments that want to develop their oil and gas resources to boost development against groups in the West, where the fossil fuels are typically exported.
Mechanical work on EACOP is expected to be finished in the first half of next year, the Petroleum Authority of Uganda said in a July post.
Standard Bank in 2021 hired an independent adviser to decide on involvement in the project, announcing three years later that it would go ahead with funding, which Tshabalala said is “below $100 million.”
The project in March secured its first tranche of syndicated financing from lenders including Standard Bank, African Export Import Bank, Stanbic Uganda Ltd., KCB Bank Uganda Ltd. and the Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector.
TotalEnergies holds a 62% stake in the line, state-owned Tanzania Petroleum Development Corp. and Uganda National Oil Co. each have a 15% interest, with the remainder owned by CNOOC Ltd., according to a website for the project.
“Our focus is unequivocally on driving Africa’s growth,” which means supporting a mix of renewable and transitional projects, Tshabalala said. “We’re completely clear that African countries have a right and a duty to use their fossil fuels to lift themselves out of poverty.”

1 New Update
At the upper price band, Urban Company’s IPO values the firm at approximately ₹14,800 crore, implying a P/E of 65.7x FY25 earnings and a P/S of 12.9x. Analysts describe the issue as “fully priced,” suggesting limited near-term upside.
Urban Company reported revenue of ₹1,144.5 crore in FY25, up 38% year-on-year. The company turned profitable with a net profit of ₹240 crore, boosted by a deferred tax credit of ₹211 crore, while pre-tax profits stood at ₹28 crore. The firm also recorded a modest but notable profit in the June 2025 quarter.
Founded in 2014, Urban Company connects customers with trained service professionals across categories including cleaning, beauty, appliance repair, pest control, plumbing, electrical, and wellness. The company also offers products such as water purifiers and electronic door locks under its “Native” brand and recently introduced InstaHelp, a micro-market daily help service.
Brokerages suggest subscribing to Urban Company’s IPO with a long-term perspective. Although near-term valuations seem high, the company’s leadership in the largely unorganized ₹60 billion home services market and its capacity to expand into new categories offer strong structural growth potential.
