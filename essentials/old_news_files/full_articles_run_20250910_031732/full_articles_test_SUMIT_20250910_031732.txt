In a stock exchange filing, Yes Bank confirmed that the RBI has approved the proposed changes that allow for the nomination of two directors by SMBC and one nominee director by SBI to the bank’s board. The changes are contingent upon the completion of transactions outlined in the SPA and other related agreements.
“We refer to our earlier stock exchange disclosure dated June 03, 2025, informing the stock exchanges of the proposed amendments to the Articles of Association (“Articles”) of the Bank pursuant to the terms of the share purchase agreement dated May 09, 2025 (“SPA”), executed by and amongst the Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (“SMBC”) and State Bank of India (“SBI”),” the company said in an exchange filing.
The bank had earlier disclosed the proposed amendments on June 3, 2025, and provided further clarity through documents shared with the exchanges, including outcome resolutions and agreement filings.
However, the bank clarified that the final consummation of the transactions under the SPA remains subject to customary conditions precedent, as outlined in the May 9 agreement.
On Tuesday, the shares of Yes Bank closed nearly 1% higher at Rs 20.35 on the BSE.

Title   : Kotak Mahindra Bank shares in focus as Sumitomo Mitsui set to sell 1.65% stake

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The sale will be executed at a floor price of Rs 1,880 per share, representing a discount of around 4% to Kotak’s last closing price, according to a CNBC-TV18 report.
As per the shareholding pattern for the June 2024 quarter, Sumitomo Mitsui held a 1.65% stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank. Post-transaction, this stake will move into public hands. Promoter holding currently stands at 25.88%, while public shareholding is at 74%.
The transaction is expected to create short-term supply pressure on the stock, but analysts remain constructive on Kotak’s long-term prospects. Brokerage firm Axis Securities has reiterated a BUY call with a target price of Rs 2,178, implying a potential upside of nearly 10% from current levels.
Despite the stake sale, Kotak’s fundamentals remain strong. The bank is among India’s largest and most diversified private lenders, with a strong presence in retail, SME, corporate, and investment banking. It operates a network of 5,440 branches and 2,927 ATMs across the country, offering a wide range of financial products and services.
Brokerages believe the block deal does not alter the bank’s long-term investment case. Axis Securities noted that pressures in asset quality, particularly in microfinance and unsecured lending, appear to have peaked. Growth is expected to accelerate in retail-focused segments such as personal loans, credit cards, and mid-market corporate lending.
Margins, which had contracted due to rate actions, are expected to stabilise at 4.7% in FY26 and improve to 5% by FY28. Credit growth is projected to clock a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17% between FY25 and FY28, supported by higher-yielding unsecured loans and easing deposit costs.
Sumitomo Mitsui has been a long-term strategic investor in Kotak and has collaborated with the bank on various financial services initiatives in the past.
