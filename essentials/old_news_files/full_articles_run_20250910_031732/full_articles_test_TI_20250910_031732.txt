(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co., Fifth Third Bancorp and Barclays Plc are among banks bracing for potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in combined losses from loans tied to subprime auto lender Tricolor Holdings, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
Fifth Third said in a regulatory filing Tuesday that it faced an impairment charge of up to $200 million after discovering alleged fraudulent activity at a commercial borrower, which it didn’t identify. The bank said it was working with law enforcement authorities.
The lenders are looking into whether collateral for warehouse lines was double-pledged, said some of the people, who asked not to be identified because of the potential for a probe by authorities.
Tricolor focuses on lending to borrowers across the US southwest who typically have poor or no credit scores. It funds the loans at least in part by packaging them into asset-backed securities to sell to bond investors, most recently selling a $217 million bond in early June, an offering led by JPMorgan and Barclays.
JPMorgan, Barclays and Fifth Third have been warehouse lenders to Tricolor, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
Daniel Chu, Tricolor’s chief executive officer, and other executives at the company didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment. Representatives for Fifth Third, JPMorgan and Barclays declined to comment.
There’s an outstanding balance of about $200 million on Fifth Third’s asset-backed finance loan in question, according to the filing. Fifth Third expects to take a non-cash charge of $170 million to $200 million in the third quarter related to that loan.
Such loans are typically backed by streams of contractual cash flows tied to a defined pool of assets, such as consumer loans or mortgages.
Tricolor’s asset-backed securities were trading lower this week after Spanish language news outlet Univision reported that the company has furloughed most of its staff.
Shares of Fifth Third dropped 2.5% to $44.30 in late trading at 5:47 p.m. in New York.

Multi-brand watch retail chain Helios, part of Titan Company, is looking to double its revenue to ₹2,000 crore in the next three years, backed by store expansion, customer acquisition and adding more brands to its portfolio.
Revenue for the multi-brand retailer of watches last fiscal stood at around ₹700 crore. “This [financial] year we are targeting ₹1,000 crore. In the next three years, we will double up our business,” Rahul Shukla, Vice-President & CSMO, watches division, Titan Company, told businessline.
“We do have an ambition that Helios as a chain of stores will probably become a ₹2,000 crore business over the next three years. It will largely be driven by expansion of footprint, expansion of the brand offering and the expansion of the consumer base,” said Shukla. Its revenue witnessed around 35 per cent CAGR over the last three years.
‘To add stores’
Helios, India’s largest retail chain of accessible luxury watches, currently has around 280 stores spread across 100 cities. “Our plan is to add roughly 50 stores nationally this financial year. We have already launched in this financial year around 20 odd stores,” added Shukla.
The retailer has a portfolio of in-house brands, licensed brands and Swiss brands, among others.
“There is a lot of consumer interest and desire, especially among the young and new-age consumers, who are very discerning and extremely exposed to international brands and trends. So, for those consumers, who want to buy international brands, this is the one-stop-shop where they can actually have accessible luxury which they can don on their wrist,” said Shukla.
The retail chain has been witnessing growth from both metro cities as well as Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. “There are 300 million consumers in India who actually have a surplus discretionary income and, hence, they are the ones who actually drive consumption. Of these 300 million consumers, around 50 per cent of them are actually not in metros,” said Shukla.
GST rates
There has been no change in GST rates as far as watches are concerned. Watches attract 18 per cent GST.
Shukla said the GST reforms will increase the discretionary income available with consumers, and a rising consumption tide with the spillover effect is also expected to lift all categories and segments. “That is why we are looking forward to a very robust season...we are seeing a lot of euphoria amongst the consumers, a feel good factor,” he said.
“We are quite upbeat about the festival season. And the first few signs from Ganesh Chaturthi onwards are quite visible. We are seeing a pretty robust uptake in the performance of our stores,” Shukla added.
