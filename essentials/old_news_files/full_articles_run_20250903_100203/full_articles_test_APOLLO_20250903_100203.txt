AMS has been on a strong bullish trajectory over the past six months, delivering an impressive 160% return during this period. This performance makes it one of the best-performing stocks in India’s defence sector, pushing its market capitalisation close to Rs 10,000 crore.
During the same period, other major defence stocks also delivered strong returns, though trailing AMS. Astra Microwave Products gained 70%, BEML rose 66%, Paras Defence and Space Technologies advanced 53%, while Bharat Electronics registered a 52% increase.
Recent Order: Notably, on August 21, the company announced the receipt of significant contracts, including a Rs 25.12 crore order from DRDO, along with additional orders from various PSUs, further strengthening its already healthy order book.
Financially, AMS posted solid results for the April–June 2025 quarter, with revenue growing 46% year-on-year to Rs 133.6 crore, up from Rs 91.2 crore in the same quarter last year.
With strong fundamentals, consistent order wins, and investor optimism around the defence sector, Apollo Micro Systems remains a key stock to watch in the coming months.
Technical Overview – Apollo Micro Systems
From a technical standpoint, Apollo Micro Systems appears to be in a strongly overbought zone. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 86.3, which is well above the typical overbought threshold of 80. This suggests that while the bullish momentum is strong, the stock may be due for a short-term pullback or consolidation.
Additionally, the stock is showing strong bullish signals across moving averages, as it is trading above all 8 key Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) — ranging from the 5-day to the 200-day SMA. This indicates a solid uptrend and sustained investor confidence over both short-term and long-term periods.
