The shares of New Delhi Television Limited (NDTV) were trading on the NSE today at ₹141.80, up by ₹2.10 or 1.50 per cent at 12.22 pm.
New Delhi Television Limited (NDTV) announced on Tuesday that its board has approved a rights issue of up to ₹400 crore to strengthen its financial position and fund expansion plans. The decision was taken at a board meeting held on September 2, 2025.
The capital raising will be offered to eligible shareholders of the news broadcasting company, which operates under AMG Media Networks Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Adani Enterprises Limited. NDTV plans to use the funds for expanding its distribution network domestically and internationally, investing in brand building, developing new intellectual properties, and reducing debt.
The company, which has been delivering English and Hindi news content since its incorporation in 1988, is focusing on digital-first growth strategies. These include branded content development, data-driven advertising approaches, and partnerships with global platforms to expand reach.
“This rights issue is a decisive step in strengthening NDTV and preparing it for its next phase of growth,” said Rahul Kanwal, CEO and Editor-in-Chief of NDTV. The company is also exploring opportunities in regional language news, international broadcasting through NDTV World, and live events.
The move comes as traditional media companies increasingly pivot toward digital platforms to capture new audiences and revenue streams. NDTV has positioned itself for what it calls “digital-first growth” while maintaining its television broadcasting operations.
