Indian e-commerce platforms like Swiggy, Zomato, and Blinkit are among other companies that will have to pay 18% goods and services tax (GST) on their delivery services under the revised GST regime effective 22 September 2025.
The central government's GST Council, in its 56th meeting on 3 September 2025, announced that e-commerce and quick commerce platforms will have to pay 18% GST on delivery charges effective 22 September 2025, part of the revamped GST structure in the Indian economy.
Even though this brings a change in the taxation system on delivery charges, which were earlier exempted, now the customers using these platforms are likely to pay more if the operators decide to hike delivery fees or platform charges.
According to multiple media reports, the e-commerce companies are evaluating their hit on the firm's revenues due to the new GST impact and are likely to pass on the effect of the GST hike to the customers to prevent the losses in operations.
Industry experts are analysing the impact of this GST rate imposition, which will be felt directly by companies, as delivery charges are a major part of their core operations. However, some reports also suggest that people using the value-added services offered by these quick commerce and online delivery companies may not be impacted by the higher charges, as they already pay extra fees for premium access.
“We would have no other option but to pass on that hit to customers, so you can expect delivery fees going up, or even delivery partner earnings taking a hit. The cost of food could also go up,” a senior executive at a food delivery company told the news portal Indian Express.
If companies decide to pass on the effect of the 18% GST on delivery services to customers, then people may have to pay a higher tax on getting their items delivered to their doorstep.
For example: A customer is ordering food worth nearly ₹500 from one of the Indian online food delivery platforms. The customer has already paid a restaurant GST of nearly ₹88, along with an almost ₹15 platform fee, inclusive of GST, on top of the packing charges.
In case the companies decide to pass on the effect of the 18% GST on delivery services, then the people ordering online have to pay more for their delivery charges to their doorstep in the form of taxes.
In its 56th meeting, the GST Council recommended that ‘local delivery services’ through an Electronic Commerce Operator (ECO) will now be included under section 9(5) of the CGST Act, which was earlier exempted from this inclusion.
The council then imposed an 18% GST rate on these services, which has to be paid by the company, hence fueling the industry debate on whether or not the company will pass on the effect of the higher GST to its customers.
This means that companies like Zomato, Swiggy, Blinkit, Zepto, among others, will have to pay 18% GST on the delivery charge they collect from people ordering on their respective e-commerce platforms, as per the updated GST norms.

“We believe that at the current price, the market is valuing only 0.3x EV/GOV for its QC business versus 0.9x for Eternal. In our view, disciplined execution and improving visibility on breakeven will be key catalysts for the stock. However, increased competition in the QC business due to aggressive expansion by other players could delay the company’s path to profitability,” said Swiggy’s Abhishek Bhandari.
He added that Swiggy’s ongoing product innovations, such as Bolt, a 10-minute quick delivery service that accounts for ~12% of overall deliveries, continue to help the company improve market share against Zomato.
“We expect a ~100 basis point market share increase for Swiggy in FY26F. Longer term, as scale builds, we expect contribution margin and adjusted EBITDA margin (as a % of gross order value, or GOV) to converge for the two players. We forecast a ~20% CAGR in GOV for Swiggy’s FD business for FY25–27F, with ~120bp improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin over the same period,” Nomura added.
Nomura also noted that the peak of dark store expansion is likely behind Swiggy, with the count nearly doubling to 1,021 by end-FY25.
Last week, Motilal Oswal upgraded its rating on Swiggy to ‘BUY’, assigning a target price of Rs 560.
“Food delivery growth slowed due to weak consumption and macro pressures, while QC profitability came under strain from heightened competition, accelerated dark store rollouts, and elevated customer acquisition costs. We now believe the cycle is turning,” Motilal Oswal said.
Betting on multiple tailwinds ahead, the brokerage raised FD growth estimates for both Zomato and Swiggy to 21–23% for FY26–27 (from 19–20% earlier) and valued FD businesses at 35x FY27E adjusted EBITDA (up from 27x earlier).
Swiggy shares were trading about 1% higher at Rs 442 on BSE on Monday morning, still down 28% from their peak of Rs 617.

Title   : Order now! With Zomato & Swiggy soaring, which stock should be in your portfolio?

Recent changes in GST rules, which impose an 18% tax on delivery fees, had initially worried investors. But analysts believe the effect will be minimal.
JM Financial notes that delivery charges are waived on nearly two-thirds of orders, while in quick commerce, Blinkit already levied GST and Swiggy’s Instamart waived most charges. Historically, both players have passed on such costs to customers.
To offset the reduction in minimum order value for subscribers, both platforms raised platform fees in recent weeks — Zomato to about Rs 14.75 per order and Swiggy to Rs 15.
While this helps margins, analysts caution that the benefit may not fully flow through to EBITDA because lower order thresholds reduce overall revenue per order.
Turning cycle in food delivery
Motilal Oswal argues that the slowdown in food delivery growth — stuck at around 17–18% — is now set to reverse. With festive demand, better consumer sentiment, and GST reforms leaving more disposable income in households, order growth could accelerate beyond 20% in the next few quarters.“We now forecast a 23% CAGR in gross order value for FY26–28, compared to 19% earlier,” the brokerage said. Both Swiggy and Zomato are expected to benefit, but the rally may not be even.
Quick commerce: the growth driver
Quick commerce, led by Blinkit for Zomato and Instamart for Swiggy, is at the heart of the growth story. The industry has shifted from a “land-grab” phase of heavy discounting and rapid dark-store expansion to a more cost-conscious model.Swiggy has slowed its rollout pace, focusing on sweating existing assets, while Blinkit benefits from density and scale. Analysts expect contribution margins to improve steadily as customer acquisition costs fall.
DAM Capital notes that Blink It's path to breakeven looks clearer, with operating breakeven expected by early FY27. Instamart, while improving, is still lagging but is narrowing losses. This divergence could influence investor preference in the near term.
Who has the edge?
Motilal Oswal has upgraded Swiggy to Buy with a target price of Rs 560 — a 32% upside from current levels. The call rests on accelerating food delivery growth and faster unit economics improvement in quick commerce. Meanwhile, Eternal (Zomato) retains a Buy rating with a target of Rs 420, or a 29% upside, thanks to strong Blinkit momentum and stable food delivery operations.JM Financial is more cautious, warning that higher platform fees may not translate into the same level of margin uplift given the lower minimum order values.
Both Swiggy and Zomato are entering a new growth phase with multiple tailwinds — festive demand, easing competition, and supportive policy changes. Zomato enjoys the comfort of profitability and Blinkit’s market leadership, while Swiggy offers higher upside potential if it can deliver on margin improvements and narrow Instamart’s losses.
Abhishek Pathak of Motilal Oswal said “the perfect storm of headwinds is behind us. Both players now face multiple tailwinds.” For investors, the choice may boil down to risk appetite: Zomato for stability and scale, Swiggy for turnaround potential.
