Dividend yield is an important metric for investors as it reflects the return they earn on their equity holdings in the form of dividends. It serves as an indicator of how much a company rewards its shareholders relative to the price of its stock. For income-focused investors, dividend yield provides clarity on the stability of earnings and the potential for consistent cash flow from their investments.
Companies that offer high dividend yields are often sought after by investors who value steady income alongside capital appreciation. These payouts not only enhance returns but also signal the financial strength and shareholder-friendly approach of a company. Here are the list of the top 10 dividend-yielding companies according to Religare Broking:
