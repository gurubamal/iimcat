--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The stock has climbed around 15% over the past week, with a one-year return of an impressive 45%, highlighting ongoing investor confidence.
HDFC Securities remains positive on MCX India, maintaining a BUY rating with a target price of Rs 10,000. The optimistic outlook is driven by key growth factors such as new product launches, technological enhancements, and increased participation, especially in gold and silver options. Rapid growth in bullion contracts is diversifying revenue streams, while upcoming cash-settled index contracts and regulatory developments are expected to boost institutional interest. MCX’s revenue and profits are forecasted to grow steadily through FY25-28, underpinning the revised target and valuation multiples.
As outlined in the previous report “The New Gold Standard,” gold and silver were expected to become major contributors to options premiums, a trend that is now clearly materialising. Options premium average daily trading volume (ADTV) jumped to around Rs 67 billion in October 2025 from Rs 41 billion in Q2FY25, driven by increased gold and silver volumes, which now account for approximately 60% of total notional volume and 30% of premium ADTV.
The company also announced that its Board will meet on November 6, 2025, to approve unaudited financial results for the quarter and half-year ending September 30, 2025. In line with Sebi regulations, the trading window for insiders will remain closed until November 9, 2025.
On the technical front, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 75.0, which is above the typical overbought threshold of 70. This indicates that the stock may be overextended and could be due for a short-term pullback or correction as traders might take profits. However, despite this signal, the stock continues to trade above all key Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), ranging from the short-term 5-day SMA to the long-term 200-day SMA. This positioning highlights a strong underlying bullish momentum and suggests that the overall uptrend remains intact.
