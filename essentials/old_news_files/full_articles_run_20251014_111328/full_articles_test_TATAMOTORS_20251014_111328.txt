--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEC International order inflows signal sector strength
Engineering major KEC International has bagged fresh orders worth nearly Rs 14,000 crore so far this financial year — about 50% of its annual guidance of Rs 28,000–30,000 crore. Pandey said this performance reflects continued momentum in the transmission and distribution (T&D) segment, which remains one of the most promising themes within the infrastructure space.“We like the entire T&D segment — both KEC International and Kalpataru Power look strong. The execution momentum is picking up, and we expect margin expansion over the next one to two years,” Pandey said.
He added that while the power generation story often takes the spotlight, power transmission and distribution will likely emerge as a key growth driver due to strong execution visibility and government capex push.
HCL Technologies shows improvement, but valuations cap upside
Commenting on the latest HCL Technologies earnings, Pandey said the numbers were broadly encouraging with signs of improvement across verticals. The company’s AI monetization, though still small at about 3% of revenue, is a step in the right direction.However, he noted that valuations are rich, limiting near-term upside.
“HCL Tech’s valuations are now similar to Infosys and TCS, which means it needs stronger earnings growth to justify further re-rating,” he said.
“TCS is already commanding a premium due to its pivot toward data centres, while HCL’s numbers need to improve more meaningfully.”
Pandey cautioned that while valuation multiples for Indian IT are near the lower end of their four-year range, the overall macro environment remains challenging, particularly given rising protectionist policies in global markets and subdued discretionary tech spending.
“Until the global AI boom cools off, we don’t expect Indian IT stocks to deliver strong price performance,” he said.
Tata Motors demerger could unlock value for investors
On Tata Motors, which officially demerged its Passenger Vehicle (PV) and Commercial Vehicle (CV) businesses this week, Pandey said the vertical split is likely to create significant value for shareholders.“We are expecting Rs 300 per share for the CV business, based on 11x FY27 EV/EBITDA multiples, in line with peers,” he said.
“The PV business could trade between ₹450–500, supported by strong growth visibility and the brand’s leadership in the electric vehicle segment.”
Pandey added that the sum-of-the-parts valuation of the two independent businesses implies overall value creation, making Tata Motors one of the more anticipated demergers in recent years.
“Both PV and CV businesses have different growth trajectories, so the split allows investors to play each theme independently,” he said.
LG Balakrishnan listing to draw investor interest
On the debut of LG Balakrishnan & Bros (LG) in the secondary market, Pandey said the listing is expected to see a positive pop, backed by a strong grey market premium.Brokerages have pegged the fair value between ₹1,750 and ₹1,800, compared to the IPO pricing of ₹1,500, which was seen as reasonable.
“The IPO was attractively priced at 37x trailing 12-month earnings, and this is the first time in a long while that a sector leader is being listed,” Pandey noted.
“The company’s strong market share across categories justifies a valuation premium, though we’ll need to see post-listing performance before assigning a definitive multiple.”
Stock-specific action to dominate ahead
Pandey expects stock-specific opportunities to dominate in the near term, with sectors like infrastructure, select auto, and utilities likely to outperform.He maintained that earnings recovery in IT, while encouraging, will take a few more quarters to translate into sustained market performance.
“While the broader market remains range-bound, focused plays in power T&D, order-heavy EPC companies, and value-unlocking stories like Tata Motors are worth tracking,” he said.

October 14 marked the record date for the separation of Tata Motors’ passenger and commercial vehicle operations. Shareholders who held shares before October 14 are entitled to one share of Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV) for every share held. TMLCV will list separately on the National Stock Exchange and BSE once regulatory approvals are completed, with shares credited to demat accounts within 30–45 days.
The parent company now includes passenger vehicles, electric vehicles, and Jaguar Land Rover operations. All existing futures and options contracts expiring in October, November, and December were settled on Monday and will resume with revised lot sizes.

Analysts weigh in
Brokerages said the split enables clearer valuation of the company’s distinct businesses. Nomura valued the passenger and commercial units almost equally—Rs 367 for Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles (TMPV) and Rs 365 for TMLCV—while warning of “technical risk for the share price” as the stock trades ex-demerger. The brokerage noted that index weight adjustments could trigger near-term volatility.SBI Securities projected TMPV to trade between Rs 285–384 post-demerger, with potential upside tied to JLR’s volume recovery and profitability. For TMLCV, the brokerage forecast a range of Rs 320–470, noting the planned €3.8 billion acquisition of Iveco Group NV’s commercial vehicle operations.
YES Securities described the separation as a “value unlocking opportunity,” noting that pure-play passenger and commercial vehicle businesses allow investors to target distinct auto cycles. Bonanza Research analyst Khushi Mistry said the demerger “will lead to sharper business focus for both entities.”

Outlook for each unit
TMLCV enters the market as India’s largest commercial vehicle maker, with a 37.1% market share and a 12.2% EBITDA margin in Q1FY26, despite revenue declines. The unit is expected to benefit from a planned €3.8 billion acquisition of Iveco Group NV’s commercial vehicle operations, which is projected to triple combined revenues and expand exposure to electric and alternative fuel powertrains.Also read | TCS, Tata Motors tumble up to 42% from peak, with over Rs 4 lakh crore wiped off Tata stocks in 2025 amid boardroom turmoil
TMPV, which derives 87% of revenue from Jaguar Land Rover, is projected to grow 8–10% in H2FY26, supported by new launches, strong SUV positioning, and rising EV and CNG demand, which constitute 45% of passenger vehicle revenue. Analysts noted that JLR’s phased manufacturing restart after a September cyberattack will influence sentiment, though early reports suggest retail-level impact was limited.

Title   : Nomura values Tata Motors passenger and commercial arms nearly equal, flags near-term volatility post demerger

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The brokerage has maintained a ‘Neutral’ rating, citing improving momentum in the passenger vehicle segment and steady prospects in the commercial business but warned that index weight adjustments could trigger near-term volatility.
The separation of Tata Motors’ passenger vehicle (PV) and commercial vehicle (CV) businesses became effective on 1 October, with 14 October set as the record date for shareholder entitlement. Following the demerger, Nomura pegged its target price at Rs 365 per share for the CV entity and Rs 367 per share for the PV entity, reflecting an almost even valuation of the two listed units.
The PV business, which will include Tata Motors’ domestic passenger vehicle arm, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), stake in Tata Sons, and investments in Tata Steel and Tata Technologies, has seen a revival in demand. “Momentum has picked up after the GST cut as festive and pent-up demand has kicked in,” Nomura said, noting strong bookings for compact and micro SUVs like the Punch and Nexon.
The brokerage added that the recently unveiled Harrier EV has received an “encouraging initial response,” with bookings surpassing early expectations. Management is targeting “double-digit EBITDA margins in the medium term (from 3.9% in 1QFY26), aided by richer mix, improved pricing, and cost efficiencies,” the note said.
JLR operations recovering post cyberattack
Jaguar Land Rover, the group’s UK-based luxury car subsidiary, has started resuming operations across its facilities after a cyber incident in September disrupted production. According to Nomura, demand “has not had any significant impact,” and production is expected to ramp up in the coming weeks.
The brokerage expects JLR’s EBIT margins at 6.2% for FY26 and 7.6% for FY27, broadly in line with management’s 5–7% guidance for FY26. However, it cautioned that “zero FCF… might have some downside risk” as the company restores operations and normalises working capital.

Commercial vehicle arm
For the CV business, which includes the domestic commercial vehicle operations and the upcoming Iveco Group acquisition, Nomura projects a 5% industry growth in FY26, implying a stronger second half of the year. The Rs 365 target incorporates the Iveco deal, valued at EUR 3.8 billion and expected to close in 2026, initially financed through debt and later 40% equity.
“At this stage, we do not assume any significant value creation from this acquisition,” Nomura said, noting Iveco’s weaker performance in 1HCY25 with revenue down 9% year-on-year and EBIT margins of 3.7% versus 6.3% a year ago. The company has guided a 5% revenue CAGR and EBIT margin expansion from 5.4% to 7.5% over 2024–28, driven by operating leverage and improved mix.

Outlook
Nomura reiterated its ‘Neutral’ stance on Tata Motors, saying it would update its estimates once pro-forma financials are available post-results. “The reduced weight in indices could pose technical risk for the share price,” the brokerage said, adding that Tata Motors currently trades at 4.6x EV/EBITDA.Tata Motors shares opened around 40% lower in early trade on Tuesday, at Rs 399, as the stock began trading ex-demerger following the separation of its commercial vehicle arm. The decline was purely notional, reflecting the removal of the CV business from the parent company’s valuation.
While the demerger marks a major structural milestone aimed at sharper business focus and value unlocking, Nomura signalled that investors may need to brace for short-term volatility as the two entities settle into their new valuations and operational rhythm.

October 14 marks the record date for the automaker’s long-awaited split into Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV) and Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV). Shareholders holding shares on or before October 13 will receive one share of TMLCV for every Tata Motors share held. Regular trading for the stock is set to resume at 10:00 AM on Tuesday.

From today, the parent company will trade without reflecting the commercial vehicles arm, explaining the notional decline in the stock. Tata Motors will be renamed Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), encompassing passenger vehicles, electric vehicles, and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) operations. Shares of TMLCV will be credited to demat accounts within 30–45 days, and the new entity will list separately on the NSE and BSE once regulatory approvals are completed.
All existing F&O contracts expiring in October, November, and December were settled on Monday and will be reintroduced with revised lot sizes from today.
Brokerages on post-demerger valuations
Brokerages expect the demerger to clarify valuations and sharpen business focus.SBI Securities said the split “enables clearer valuation of the company’s distinct businesses.” TMPV, which derives 87% of revenue from JLR, is expected to trade between Rs 285 and Rs 384 post-demerger, with potential upside linked to JLR’s volume recovery and profitability.
For TMLCV, SBI Securities projected a range of Rs 320–470, noting its planned €3.8 billion acquisition of Iveco Group NV’s commercial vehicle operations, expected to triple combined revenues and expand exposure in electric and alternative fuel powertrains. “The integration of Iveco Group NV, most likely in FY27, will expose the company to the global CV cycle,” the brokerage said, while flagging near-term margin dilution due to Iveco’s lower EBIT margin.
YES Securities described the demerger as a “value unlocking opportunity,” noting that pure-play passenger and commercial vehicle businesses will allow investors to target distinct auto cycles.
Bonanza Research Analyst Khushi Mistry said the separation “will lead to sharper business focus for both entities.” TMLCV enters the market as India’s largest commercial vehicle maker, with a 37.1% market share and 12.2% EBITDA margin in Q1FY26, despite a revenue decline. TMPV is expected to grow 8–10% in H2FY26, supported by new launches, strong SUV positioning, and rising EV and CNG demand, which constitute 45% of its passenger vehicle revenue.

JLR recovery to influence sentiment
Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), Tata Motors’ UK-based subsidiary, began a phased manufacturing restart on October 8 after a cyberattack in early September disrupted global operations. Khushi Mistry said the incident caused a 24% drop in wholesale volumes and a 17% decline in retail sales during the September quarter, with estimated losses of £50 million per week. “Full production is expected to resume post-Christmas due to the scale of restoration needed,” she added.YES Securities noted that “2QFY26 JLR dispatches (-24% YoY and QoQ) were impacted by production losses due to the cyberattack from early Sep’25. However, the retail-level impact was much lower. We expect volumes to gradually improve in 3Q and 4Q, which should support sentiment.”
Implications for shareholders
Shareholders will receive one share of TMLCV for every Tata Motors share held. The cost of acquisition for both entities will be communicated later for portfolio and tax adjustments.Near-term volatility is expected as the stock adjusts to the new structure. Analysts say the longer-term outlook depends on JLR’s production recovery and TMLCV’s performance post-Iveco integration.
Investors are now watching whether the demerger will reignite momentum in Tata Motors’ shares or whether value creation will take time to materialise.
