HMIL has installed 119 public EV fast charging stations as on August 2025, out of the planned 600 stations across India, with a focus on electrifying key highways, major cities and HMIL dealerships. Over 2.3 million units of energy have been dispensed through 1,80,000+ charging sessions to both B2C and B2B customer segments, according to a release, as the World EV Day is observed today.
Leveraging its existing charging infrastructure, HMIL has facilitated the reduction of more than 1.6 million kg of tailpipe CO₂ emissions - underscoring its steadfast commitment to India’s carbon neutrality mission, the release said.
Jae Wan Ryu, Function Head – Corporate Planning, HMIL, in the release said, “At Hyundai Motor India, we are strongly positioned to lead the acceleration of EV adoption across the country. We have significantly expanded our EV retail footprint with 542 sales outlets across 238 cities, as of August 2025. In alignment with the Government of India’s vision for mass mobility electrification, HMIL remains committed to strategic investments in both new-age EV platforms and robust charging infrastructure,” he said.
