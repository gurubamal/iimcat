Multi-brand watch retail chain Helios, part of Titan Company, is looking to double its revenue to ₹2,000 crore in the next three years, backed by store expansion, customer acquisition and adding more brands to its portfolio.
Revenue for the multi-brand retailer of watches last fiscal stood at around ₹700 crore. “This [financial] year we are targeting ₹1,000 crore. In the next three years, we will double up our business,” Rahul Shukla, Vice-President & CSMO, watches division, Titan Company, told businessline.
“We do have an ambition that Helios as a chain of stores will probably become a ₹2,000 crore business over the next three years. It will largely be driven by expansion of footprint, expansion of the brand offering and the expansion of the consumer base,” said Shukla. Its revenue witnessed around 35 per cent CAGR over the last three years.
‘To add stores’
Helios, India’s largest retail chain of accessible luxury watches, currently has around 280 stores spread across 100 cities. “Our plan is to add roughly 50 stores nationally this financial year. We have already launched in this financial year around 20 odd stores,” added Shukla.
The retailer has a portfolio of in-house brands, licensed brands and Swiss brands, among others.
“There is a lot of consumer interest and desire, especially among the young and new-age consumers, who are very discerning and extremely exposed to international brands and trends. So, for those consumers, who want to buy international brands, this is the one-stop-shop where they can actually have accessible luxury which they can don on their wrist,” said Shukla.
The retail chain has been witnessing growth from both metro cities as well as Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. “There are 300 million consumers in India who actually have a surplus discretionary income and, hence, they are the ones who actually drive consumption. Of these 300 million consumers, around 50 per cent of them are actually not in metros,” said Shukla.
GST rates
There has been no change in GST rates as far as watches are concerned. Watches attract 18 per cent GST.
Shukla said the GST reforms will increase the discretionary income available with consumers, and a rising consumption tide with the spillover effect is also expected to lift all categories and segments. “That is why we are looking forward to a very robust season...we are seeing a lot of euphoria amongst the consumers, a feel good factor,” he said.
“We are quite upbeat about the festival season. And the first few signs from Ganesh Chaturthi onwards are quite visible. We are seeing a pretty robust uptake in the performance of our stores,” Shukla added.
