--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Delhi: Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd, Reliance Industries Ltd’s retail arm, on Friday reported a consolidated profit of ₹3,457 crore for the September quarter, up 22% from a year ago.
Revenue from operations grew 19% year-on-year to ₹79,128 crore.
The retailer's Ebitda rose 16.5% year-on-year to ₹6,816 crore, while Ebitda margin fell by 20 basis points to 8.6%. Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and is a measure of core operations.
Reliance Retail operates across categories such as grocery, consumer electronics, fashion and lifestyle, and online commerce.
Isha M. Ambani, executive director, Reliance Retail Ventures, on Friday said the business delivered strong performance during the quarter led by the company's focus on operational excellence, investments in stores and digital platforms and festive buying across consumption baskets.
“GST rate changes will further accelerate consumption growth as consumers get the benefit of lower prices… We consistently innovate, from curating new collections to creating campaigns that connect with today's Indian consumer, and our focus remains on building brands that inspire and resonate across India,” she added.
Grocery and fashion & lifestyle businesses grew 23% and 22% year-on-year, respectively, led by festive buying. Consumer electronics delivered 18% year-on-year growth aided by GST rate reduction and new launches.
RRVL's earnings closely coincide with Dhanteras and Diwali; the quarter also saw GST-linked disruptions that hurt sales in the first half of September. Nonetheless, categories such as air conditioners and televisions, sold under its Reliance Digital retail brand, benefited the company due to a reduction in tax rates.
The company reported a consolidated profit of ₹3,271 crore in the April-June quarter, up 28.3% from a year ago. Revenue from operations grew 11.3% year-on-year to ₹73,720 crore.
Reliance Retail opened 412 new stores during the September quarter, taking its total store count to 19,821, up 4.6% year-on-year.
Despite adding new stores, area under operations shrunk 2% to 77.8 million square feet in the September quarter versus 79.4 million sq. ft. in the year-ago period. In the year-ago period, it added 464 new stores, while in the June quarter it opened 388 new stores.
Last fiscal year, the company's retail business saw a period of subdued performance primarily due to an operational rationalisation done by the company that saw the retailer shutter large format stores across categories such as grocery and fashion to open smaller stores across formats.
However, during the company's June quarter earnings call, the management had said the business is now on the path of growing its store network.
“We believe improvement in retail should act as a catalyst for the stock, especially given the implied low valuation for retail. We expect core retail to grow 12% year-on-year top line with FY25-28E CAGR at 13% (vs 5% year-on-year in FY25). Analysts expected the retail business to grow at 14% year-on-year, partially helped by a favorable base (impacted by strategic recalibration of store network),” said Axis Bank analysts in a 13 October report.
The company's grocery business saw double-digit growth year-on-year in core categories with packaged food grew by 20%, staples grew by 18%, and home and personal care (HPC) grew by 13%. Additionally, the volume of fruits and vegetables was up by 62% year-on-year.
The company’s consumer electronics business growth was driven by the festive build-up, though demand was impacted between the announcement and implementation of lower GST rates on 22nd September 2025, with a strong pickup occurring after that date. Laptops grew by 37%, Mobiles grew by 22%, and appliances grew by 10% on year-on-year basis.
Additionally, RIL has initiated a restructuring to spin off its fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) brands into a new entity, New Reliance Consumer Products Ltd (New RCPL), ahead of its much-anticipated IPO of its retail business. As part of the restructuring, RCPL will operate as a direct subsidiary of RIL. It was earlier a step-down subsidiary through Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd.
The RCPL demerger is a process in progress, and is awaiting a final order from the National Company Law Tribunal, it said on Friday.
In the September quarter, the company's fast-moving consumer goods business reported gross revenue of ₹5,400 crore.
Its cola brand Campa sustained double-digit market share in key markets for Campa, with positive growth momentum across categories led by Campa and Independence.
At the company's 48th annual general meeting in August, management set a revenue target of ₹1 trillion for its packaged consumer products business, RCPL, in five years.

Title   : Proxy adviser ISS urges Tesla shareholders to reject Elon Musk's $1 trillion pay package ahead of Nov 6 vote

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joining in the push back against Tesla's proposed $1 trillion pay package for CEO Elon Musk, proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), urged shareholders to vote against the plan on November 6, Bloomberg reported.
It added that this is the second year in a row that ISS has opposed a pay package for Elon Musk, and urged shareholders to vote against it.
Among other reasons, ISS on October 17 expressed concern over Elon Musk's split attention between his five businesses, which include Tesla — the other four being Neuralink, SpaceX, the Boring Company and xAI.
In a guidance issued to shareholders ahead of the vote on November 6, ISS said that while the sky-high pay package is designed to retain Elon Musk at Tesla and keep his attention on the electronic vehicle (EV) maker, “there are no explicit requirements to ensure that this will be the case”.
It further cited “unmitigated concerns” with the plan’s magnitude and design, the report added.
In a post on Elon Musk-owned social media site X (formerly Twitter), Tesla posted a response to ISS's stance on the hefty compensation plan, and urged shareholders to back its recommendations.
“ISS once again completely misses fundamental points of investing and governance. They recommended against compensation that shareholders have voted on twice before (and that Elon has already earned), as well as the 2025 CEO Performance Award (where Elon receives nothing unless shareholders win big),” the company's official account posted.
It called ISS's recommendation as “unfounded and nonsensical”, and claimed that this “proves how disconnected from reality they are”.
“As Tesla’s longest-tenured independent director, Ira has created a governance framework that has allowed Tesla to achieve an astonishing TSR increase of ~39,000% during his tenure. He embodies our high-engagement Board – with hands-on leadership + effective governance with a focus on long-term value,” it added.
Tesla urged, “It’s easy for ISS to tell others how to vote when they have nothing on the line. Vote with Tesla on ALL proposals.”
On October 2, Tesla investors, including state officials, also opposed Tesla's $1 trillion pay package for Elon Musk, Forbes reported. Shareholders urged other investors to reject the pay package at Tesla's annual shareholder meeting on November 6, as per the report.
The letter, signed by prominent investors, including the SOC Investment Group, and American Federation of Teachers; the state treasurers of Nevada, New Mexico, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Colorado and the comptrollers of Maryland and New York City, accused the board of “harming Tesla's reputation” in their fight to retain Elon Musk.
Tesla shareholders will vote on the pay package at the annual meeting on November 6.
Notably, ISS and fellow proxy firm Glass Lewis both advised shareholders to also reject Elon Musk’s 2018 pay deal, where around 75 per cent of investors still supported the package.
In 2024, a Delaware judge struck down that plan after finding Elon Musk had undue influence over the process and the board had conflicts of interest. The world's richest person later cited the pay dispute as part of the reason why Tesla shifted its corporate home to Texas from Delaware.
Elon Musk and Tesla resumed their legal fight to appeal the ruling, this time before the Delaware Supreme Court on October 15.
(With inputs from Bloomberg)
Key Takeaways
- Proxy advisers like ISS can significantly influence shareholder decisions.
- Musk's compensation plan aims to retain his focus on Tesla amidst his various businesses.
- Concerns about conflicts of interest and governance persist in Musk's compensation proposals.

Title   : RIL Q2 profit up 10% on strong consumer business, O2C recovery

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reliance Industries reported a 9.7 per cent rise in consolidated net profit in the second quarter, and revenue up 10 per cent, led by oil-to-chemicals, retail and digital services.
The conglomerate reported net profit of ₹18,165 crore on revenue of ₹2.6 lakh crore.
The company said there was a strong contribution from the consumer business, while a recovery in the O2C business led to its highest quarterly throughput of 20.8 million tonnes, up 3 per cent on year.
Commenting on the robust performance, Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani said it reflected the agile business operations, domestic-focused portfolio and structural growth in the Indian economy.
The O2C segment contributed half of total revenue, while retail and digital together accounted for around 42 per cent, an indicator of the changing business mix of RIL.
Despite continued volatility in the energy markets, the O2C business did good business with the recovery in fuel margins. Its EBITDA at ₹12,413 crore rose 21 per cent, led by a sharp recovery in fuel cracks and improvement in polymer deltas. EBITDA margin improved 130 bps.
Digital services business was scaling up and in Jio, “We continue to augment our capabilities with pioneering systems and platforms, ensuring the benefits of the ever-evolving technology landscape for all Indians,” Ambani said.
Sustained improvement in ARPUs, robust subscriber adds, as well as a 30 per cent increase in data traffic contributed to the performance of digital services, which was the highest contributor to the overall group EBITDA.
RIL is preparing to list Jio in the first half of 2026 and this will unlock value in the digital services business.
The retail segment is the second largest revenue contributor and Reliance Retail, as part of its expansion, has signed agreements to set up food parks across several states.
The downstream chemicals business continued to be hampered by overcapacity. “Corrective steps by industry stakeholders will help balance global downstream markets in the medium-term,” he said.
Lower production in the KGD6 basin was offset to some extent by higher price realisation and the management said it was exploring other areas to augment volumes.
In the new energy business, RIL has grand plans to provide clean energy around the clock, and it has already commissioned four PV modules, while the first cell line will be commissioned soon. It expects to start generating solar power in the first half of next year for captive purposes.
The capital expenditure during the quarter at around ₹40,000 crore, which was 66 per cent lower from the first quarter. Its outstanding debt at the end of September rose around 3 per cent to Rs 3.5 lakh crore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RIL reported consolidated profit of ₹22,146 crore for the second quarter, up from ₹19,101 crore a year prior. Net profit attributable to the owners of the firm was up 10% to ₹18,165 crore from ₹16,563 crore in the year before. Revenue grew 10% to ₹2.83 lakh crore. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) rose 15% to ₹50,367 crore.
“Reliance delivered a robust performance during 2QFY26 led by strong contributions from O2C, Jio, and retail businesses,” said Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director, Reliance Industries. “Consolidated ebitda registered 14.6% growth on a yo-y basis, reflecting agile business operations, domestic focused portfolio, and structural growth in the Indian economy.”
The O2C business posted a 3% increase in revenue to ₹1.6 lakh crore in the second quarter, while ebitda expanded 21% to ₹15,008 crore. RIL is building the world's only integrated solar photovoltaic (PV) giga factory, said Sriram Ramakrishnan of the new energy business.
Focus on Sustainability
The company’s solar cell unit will be operational next month.
“We are making good progress in readying our first battery storage factory next year,” he said. “We have now commissioned four solar PV module lines. Next month, we will begin solar cell production. We have made significant progress for a 40GWh battery storage production unit.”
Sustainability is a key theme. “We are looking to produce green chemicals, sustainable aviation fuels using green hydrogen,” said Ramakrishnan. “With increasing electrification, the requirement for power is rising. We are looking to provide renewable power round the clock at an attractive price point than fossil fuel… We are looking to produce green chemicals, sustainable aviation fuels using green hydrogen.”
Amit Chaturvedi, president of the petrochemicals segment, said that demand is bouncing back for polymers and polyesters after GST rationalisation.
“Reliance cracker operating rate was 100% vs global cracked rate—80% driven by domestic demand and better inventory,” he said.
TELECOM, RETAIL
Jio Platforms Ltd. (JPL), which holds Reliance Industries’ telecom and digital businesses, posted a 12.8% rise in September quarter net profit to Rs 7,379 crore from the year earlier, boosted mainly by a rise in higher-paying data users and strong subscriber additions. JPL reported a 14.6% growth in revenue from operations to Rs 36,332 crore on user additions and improvement in average revenue per user (ARPU).
Net profit at Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd rose 22% to Rs 3,457 crore from a year earlier, while gross revenue increased 18% to ₹90,018 crore. Net revenue rose 19% to ₹79,128 crore. It operated 19,821 stores at the end of September.
“Our quick hyper-local deliveries continue to be in a strong trajectory with 42% growth on a quarter-on-quarter and 200% growth on a y-o-y basis in terms of average daily orders,” said Dinesh Taluja, chief financial officer, Reliance Retail. “The demand is not a concern right now in terms of availability of gas in India. We are looking at expanding in the east coast of India.”
Ahead of the earnings announcement, RIL closed 1.35% higher on the BSE on Friday at ₹1,416.95. The benchmark Sensex ended the session 0.58% higher. Earnings were announced after market hours. The company said the renewable energy business will begin adding to the company’s earnings next year.

Title   : Reliance Q2 results: Profit surges 16% as all three engines gain steam

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd outlined clear plans for its new-energy ventures—seen as the next growth engines for India’s most valuable company—even as its oil exploration business emerged as a weak link in an otherwise strong September quarter.
Reliance will begin operations at its first solar cell production line in Jamnagar this month, while its solar energy plants at Kutch will start generating power from the first half of 2026-27, the company said in an investor presentation on Friday.
It did not provide a further update on its new-energy giga-complex at Jamnagar. The project is touted to be the world's largest single-location clean energy complex that will turn sand into solar modules, and use the clean power from these modules to generate green hydrogen and run data centres.
Reliance’s fast-moving-consumer-goods business, another key growth driver, saw second-quarter revenue doubling from a year earlier to ₹5,400 crore, placing it ahead of other legacy FMCG companies. The demerger of the FMCG business, which will see it becoming a direct subsidiary of Reliance Industries, is progressing, the company said.
However, production from Reliance Industries’s key Krishna Godavari D6 block fell for a fourth straight quarter.
Overall, Reliance Industries reported a consolidated profit of ₹22,146 crore for the second quarter, up 16% from ₹19,101 crore a year earlier, on the back of improved profitability across all three of its key businesses: oil–to–chemicals (O2C), telecom, and retail. Revenue grew 10% on-year to ₹2.83 trillion, while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) grew 15% to ₹50,367 crore.
However, revenue in Reliance’s oil exploration and production business fell 3% to ₹6,058 crore, and Ebitda by 5% to ₹5,002 crore.
“Reliance delivered a robust performance during 2QFY26 led by strong contributions from O2C, Jio, and Retail businesses,” said Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director, Reliance Industries. “Consolidated Ebitda registered 14.6% growth on a Y-o-Y basis, reflecting agile business operations, domestic focused portfolio, and structural growth in the Indian economy.”
Reliance Industries’s O2C business, which refines crude oil into fuel and other chemicals, benefitted from a sharp growth in fuel cracks—the difference between the price of crude oil and the fuel produced from it—during the quarter. This was due to a fall in crude oil prices and an increase in demand for transportation fuels.
This helped improve Reliance’s gross refining margin (GRM), a key indicator of a refinery's profitability. Every $1 per barrel increase in GRM will translate to a 2% increase in consolidated Ebitda and a 4% increase in net profit for Reliance Industries in 2026–27, as per JP Morgan analysts.
Revenue from the O2C business increased 3% on-year to ₹1.6 trillion in the second quarter, while Ebitda expanded 21% to ₹15,008 crore.
Reliance Industries’ telecom business surpassed 500 million subscribers during the second quarter, while its average revenue per use (ARPU) increased 1% from the April-June period to ₹211.4.
Revenue of Jio Platforms Ltd, which houses Reliance’s telecom business, grew 15% on-year to ₹42,652 crore, while Ebitda grew 18% to ₹18,757 crore.
Jio Platforms, which also houses the company’s digital business, is headed for a public markets debut next year.
Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd, which houses the company’s retail business, reported an 18% increase in revenue to ₹90,018 crore and a 17% increase in Ebitda to ₹6,816 crore. The business benefitted from a reduction in the goods and services tax (GST) rate during the quarter and the start of the festive season.
“These are pretty good numbers. O2C has performed well after a long time, while Jio ARPU was marginally better than market expectations. Fantastic numbers from FMCG,” said Sudip Bandyopadhyay, group chairman at financial services firm Inditrade Capital Ltd.
“I would’ve loved more updates on the new energy business, which they haven’t talked much about,” he added.
Reliance Industries’s stock closed 1.35% higher on BSE on Friday at ₹1,416.95. The benchmark Sensex index ended the session 0.58% higher. The earnings were disclosed post trading hours.
