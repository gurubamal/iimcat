Radico Khaitan is launching its super-premium Morpheus Whisky in Karnataka, Goa, West Bengal and Haryana, the company announced today. The expansion comes after strong performance in its initial markets of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi, where the brand has achieved over 90 per cent distribution in A and B category outlets.
The company aims to establish presence in more than 12 states by the end of FY 2026. Morpheus, launched earlier this year as Radico Khaitan’s first entry into the super-premium whisky segment, has exceeded the company’s expectations in its debut market of Uttar Pradesh.
The 750 ml bottle will be priced at ₹1,830 in Karnataka, ₹900 in Haryana and Goa, and ₹1,400 in West Bengal. Current pricing stands at ₹1,190 in UP, ₹1,400 in Rajasthan and ₹1,100 in Delhi.
Managing Director Abhishek Khaitan said Indian consumers are increasingly seeking premium experiences that combine craftsmanship with character. Chief Operating Officer Amar Sinha attributed the early success to growing demand for super-premium offerings.
The whisky is crafted with imported Scotch malts and Indian grain spirits, aged in bourbon barrels. It is available in five sizes ranging from 60 ml to 750 ml. Radico Khaitan, which began operations in 1943, is among India’s largest IMFL manufacturers and exports to over 100 countries.
The shares of Radico Khaitan Limited ended on the NSE today at ₹3,116 up by ₹118.10 or 3.94 per cent.
