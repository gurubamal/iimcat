--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Accelerated provisions on microfinance business, sharp reduction in the microfinance portfolio and lack of treasury gains impacted IndusInd Bank’s bottomline in the second quarter (Q2FY26).
The private sector lender slipped into the red, reporting a net loss of ₹445 crore against a net profit of ₹1,325 crore in the year ago quarter and ₹684 crore in the preceding (Q1FY26) quarter.
Rajiv Anand, who took charge of the Bank as MD & CEO on August 25, 2025, observed that the financial impact was partly offset by improvement in cost of funds (to 5.43 per cent in Q2FY26 from 5.69 per cent in Q1FY26), as well as containing operating expenses (nudged up 2 per cent to ₹4,013 crore from ₹3,932 crore in Q2FY25).
“We have written off ₹1,579 crore of microfinance loans and increased coverage on the residual MFI non-performing assets (NPAs). We believe this is a prudent measure and strengthens the balance sheet,” he said.
The Bank’s micro loans portfolio declined ₹7,087 crore during the quarter to stand at ₹21,321 crore as at September-end 2025.
Anand underscored that while the bank will continue to grow in its key domains — vehicle finance and microlending, it sees huge opportunities to grow the retail asset businesses. This is to not only diversify the loan portfolio but also to support the liability franchise.
“The MSME space is a large opportunity for a bank of our size. We have a minuscule presence here, and we will grow it as we go forward. We have a small presence in the home loans segment, but scale this irrespective of the cost of funds disadvantage,” the IndusInd Bank chief said.
“The unsecured segments, too, are now poised for cyclical growth. We believe the retail segment will contribute meaningfully to our growth in the future,” he added.
Reviewing every single business
Anand said he and the senior team are reviewing every single business and support function to be able to zero-in on the opportunities for the Bank to improve its functioning and grow business.
This observation comes in the backdrop of the Bank accounting for the discrepancies identified during the financial year ended on 3l March.2025 in relation to the accounting of derivative trades amounting to ₹1,959.98 crore, accounting of interest and fee income totalling ₹846.40 crore pertaining to MFI portfolio, and manual entries posted in the ‘Other Assets’ and ‘Other Liabilities’ amounting to ₹595 crore.
To a question on whether the Bank will fix accountability for the aforementioned lapses, Anand replied in the affirmative, with action likely in the next couple of quarters.
