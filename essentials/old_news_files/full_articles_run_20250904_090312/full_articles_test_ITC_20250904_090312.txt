ITC Limited shares surged 1.53 per cent to ₹418.05 in morning trade on September 4, 2025, following Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcement that cigarettes and tobacco products will continue at existing GST rates despite the broader tax restructuring.
The stock opened at ₹423.95 against the previous close of ₹411.75 and touched a high of ₹427.00 during early trading hours. Trading volumes reached 146.02 lakh shares worth ₹613.74 crore by 10:15 AM, with 66.24 per cent of traded quantity being deliverable trades.
The 56th GST Council meeting on Wednesday approved a complete overhaul of the tax structure, simplifying the current four-slab system to just two rates of 5 per cent and 18 per cent, effective September 22. However, tobacco products, cigarettes, and gutkha will maintain the current 28 per cent GST plus compensation cess until loans taken to compensate states for revenue losses are fully repaid.
Other tobacco stocks including Godfrey Phillips India and VST Industries are also expected to benefit from the unchanged tax structure. ITC’s market capitalisation stands at ₹5,23,739.78 crore with the stock trading near its 52-week range of ₹390.15-₹528.50.

Title   : Explained: Why ITC shares jumped after GST overhaul hit cigarettes

ITC shares rose with other tobacco counters also gaining on the day. The move came after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that while the GST Council has cut most items to two slabs of 5% and 18%, sin goods such as cigarettes, paan masala and gutka have been placed in a separate high-tax category of 40% levy.
GST overhaul
The GST Council, in its 56th meeting, approved a plan to simplify the indirect tax structure from four slabs—5%, 12%, 18% and 28%—to just two rates of 5% and 18%. A new 40% slab has been proposed for a small category of items including luxury cars, tobacco and cigarettes.
Sitharaman said that for now, tobacco and related products will continue to be taxed at 28% plus a compensation cess until loans taken to cover states’ revenue shortfall are fully repaid. Once that obligation is cleared, the levy will shift to a flat 40% GST slab.
Why is the market optimistic?
Brokerage Jefferies said the new regime could turn out to be favorable for ITC. “Tobacco/ITC could potentially benefit, as the shift to ad-valorem rate of 40% (likely by year-end) implies a ~5ppt tax cut. Also, the regime potentially removes tax uncertainty, a positive for ITC,” it said.
Tobacco is currently taxed at 28% GST plus a cess that mixes specific and ad valorem duties. The proposed structure would instead impose a 40% levy on the retail selling price, with no compensation cess. Jefferies added, “Even if NCCD continues at the current rate, the total tax incidence on cigarettes will be lower by about 5%, based on our understanding.”
The brokerage said, “If revised lower tax is confirmed, we expect the tobacco industry to take down prices which would make them competitive against illicit competition and help gain share.”
Timing in focus
While the government has set September 22 as the implementation date for the broader GST changes, Jefferies pointed out that the benefits for ITC depend on how quickly the shift to the new regime is executed and whether any fresh levies are introduced to offset the revenue impact.
