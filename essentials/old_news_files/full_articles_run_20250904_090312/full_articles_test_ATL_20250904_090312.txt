Bengaluru
Atlassian has announced a new R&D Centre in Bengaluru. Spanning 2 lakh plus square feet, the new space is four times the size of the company’s previous Bengaluru office, with the company deepening its investment in the region as a strategic R&D hub.
India is one of Atlassian’s fastest-growing R&D sites and plays a central role in the development of its products. Nearly 75 per cent of Atlassian’s India team are in R&D roles, contributing to some of its most strategic product development areas, from enterprise search and commerce to data residency and customer success. India has Atlassian’s largest workforce outside of Australia and the US, with more than 2,500 employees.
Rajeev Rajan, Chief Technology Officer at Atlassian said, “India continues to be one of our most important R&D hubs, and Bengaluru sits at the heart of this growth. This new world-class R&D Centre is more than just a larger space, it’s a symbol of our investment in the future of work, in distributed teamwork, and most importantly, in the exceptional talent we have here in India. The team is truly building cutting-edge solutions for our global market, and we’re thrilled to give them a vibrant space to connect, create, and collaborate.”
The space features flexible workstations, collaborative zones, wellness areas, and cutting-edge technology to support hybrid teams.
Avani Prabhakar, Chief People Officer at Atlassian said, “Our new R&D Centre is a destination for the incredible talent we have in India - designed for how we work today and how we will work tomorrow. Our Team Anywhere approach allows us to attract and retain top talent, regardless of location. We have Atlassians in almost every Indian State - tapping into the amazing skillsets across the country, as well as metro cities.”
The Bengaluru expansion is part of Atlassian’s global strategy to scale its operations. The new office joins Atlassian’s network of globally distributed workplaces and strengthens its presence in the broader Asia-Pacific region.
Atlassian established its presence in India in 2018 with a team of 60. Today, India is one of the fastest-growing regions in terms of headcount.

Title   : Zijin Gold said to plan $3 billion HK IPO in world’s biggest listing since CATL

The size and timing of Zijin Gold International Co.’s listing could still change as deliberations are ongoing, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter. The listing could come as soon as this month and investor interest in the offering has been exceptionally strong as gold prices hover near all-time highs, one of the people said.
Zijin Mining and the gold unit didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Should the deal go as planned, it would be the world’s biggest listing since Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd.’s blockbuster $5.3 billion offering in May, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. As for Zijin, it would join the growing wave of Chinese miners capitalizing on rising gold prices.
Zijin Mining, China’s biggest gold miner, churned out 73 tons of the precious metal last year, of which 60% came from overseas, according to Bloomberg calculations. The mining giant is targeting to increase production to 100 tons to 110 tons by 2028.
The IPO comes after bullion broke out of a months-long trading range, notching fresh records on the back of central-bank purchases, rate cut hopes and investors’ push to diversify away from the US dollar. Several Wall Street banks have forecast more gains to come, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. seeing gold climbing to as high as $4,000 an ounce next year.
The deal would also mark another trophy for Hong Kong and the banner year it’s having attracting new listings. Thanks to a surge of listings by Chinese companies, proceeds in Hong Kong’s IPO market are poised to more than double to over $26 billion, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates.
IFR earlier reported that Zijin Gold’s IPO target was raised to at least $3 billion from about $2 billion.
