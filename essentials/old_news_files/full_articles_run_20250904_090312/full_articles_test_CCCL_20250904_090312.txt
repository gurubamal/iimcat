Mumbai, September 04
Nisus Finance Services, a leading investor with a strong focus on urban infrastructure, has acquired a majority stake in New Consolidated Construction Company Ltd (NCCCL) through its subsidiary, Nisus Finance Projects LLP.
As part of the acquisition, Nisus has infused ₹70 crore as primary growth capital, strengthening NCCCL’s balance sheet and positioning the company to capture high-potential opportunities in India’s fast-evolving building infrastructure landscape.
The deal will integrate Nisus’ capital strength with NCCCL’s eight-decade legacy in construction enabling a robust end-to-end urban infrastructure platform.
It also enhances Nisus’ ability to participate in value creation not just through financing, but also by capturing operating leverage in the construction value chain.
With urbanisation, housing demand, smart cities and new-age assets such as data centres and logistics hubs driving demand, Nisus is strategically placed to channel capital into these high-growth verticals.
By combining financing expertise with direct exposure to execution, Nisus expects to enhance both its AUM and return on capital employed.
Amit Goenka, Chairman and Managing Director, Nisus Finance Services, said the acquisition provides a unique synergy between the company’s vision for urban infrastructure and NCCCL’s decades of execution excellence.
With leadership continuity and institutional alignment, the deal will build a future-ready platform designed to deliver sustained value, he added.
Abbas Jasdanwalla, Chairman, NCCCL said the partnership with Nisus Finance allows the company to embark on a new phase of transformative growth.
Mahesh Mudda, MD & CEO, NCCCL said the investment will help the company expand into high-growth verticals such as data centre infrastructure and smart urban developments, backed by tech-first construction methodologies and institutional governance.
