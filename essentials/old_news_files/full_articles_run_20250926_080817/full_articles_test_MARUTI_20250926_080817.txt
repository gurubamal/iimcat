Country’s largest passenger vehicles maker, Maruti Suzuki India (MSIL) on Thursday said that it is getting a lot of traction at its showrooms since September 22, and has sold around 80,000 units in this last four days of Navratris.
The company is also getting enquiries of around 80,000 per day, which is double of other days, Partho Banerjee, Senior Executive Officer - Marketing & Sales, MSIL, said.
On the first day of GST 2.0 and Navratri on September 22, MSIL had delivered over more than 30,000 vehicles and secured bookings for of more than 75,000 cars.
“After the start of the Navratris, our retails have touched 75,000 vehicles (till 6PM on Thursday). We are expecting that this will further be going up by the end of the day and cross 80,000 units. The bookings are very strong,” Banerjee told reporters in a briefing with select mediapersons.
In the entry-level cars segment also (S-Presso and Alto K10), he said the company was seeing “very good traction” with the all-India booking growth of 50 per cent. “In places beyond the top 100 cities, the growth in the booking is to the tune of 100 per cent,” he noted.
Overall bookings
On the overall bookings currently, he said on an average, MSIL is getting close to 18,000 bookings per day as compared to around 10,000 per day on normal days.
Lauding the Centre’s decision for the GST rate reduction, Banerjee also said, “Customers were just waiting for it and this is a golden opportunity for the customers to upgrade to a four-wheeler...they just need to expedite their finance process to get the delivery during the festive period.”
In some of the variants of certain models like Brezza, Dzire and Baleno, he said MSIL may not be able to supply after four-five days because of the very high demand, since production cannot be suddenly increased, he added.
