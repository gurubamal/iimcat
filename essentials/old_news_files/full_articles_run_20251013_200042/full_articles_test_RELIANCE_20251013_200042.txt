--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tata Mutual Fund has decided to temporarily suspend subscription to the units in Tata Silver ETF Fund of Fund (FoF) with effect from October 14, 2025, due to prevailing market conditions and shortage of physical silver in the domestic market.
However, all existing SIP (systematic investment plan) and STP (systematic trading plan) registered under the Tata Silver ETF FoF (scheme) will remain operational.
Moreover, during this suspension period, redemptions, switch-out, and Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) will continue to be permitted in accordance with the terms outlined in the Scheme Information Document.
Noting that silver is trading at a premium relative to international prices, Tata MF, in an addendum to the Tata Silver ETF FoF, said the premium in domestic silver prices directly impacts the valuation of the scheme.
“In light of the current market scenario, Tata Mutual Fund has decided to temporarily suspend all lump sum investments, switch-in into the scheme & fresh registration of SIP and STP into the scheme from the effective date....The aforesaid suspension is temporary in nature and shall continue only till further notice in this regard,” per the addendum.
The scheme is an open-ended FoF investing in Tata Silver Exchange Traded Fund (Tata Silver ETF). Tata Silver ETF is an open-ended scheme replicating/tracking Domestic Price of Silver.

Title   : JPMorgan to Plow $1.5 Trillion Into US Security Industries

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JPMorgan Chase & Co. vowed to funnel $1.5 trillion into industries that bolster US economic security and resiliency over the next 10 years — an initiative that will invest billions of dollars in companies and hire bankers and other professionals.
The campaign will ramp up the amount of capital, resources and personnel that the largest US lender already dedicates to a variety of sectors, such as rare earth minerals, pharmaceutical precursors and robotics, or ventures developing defense, aerospace and energy technologies, such as drones, battery storage or grid resiliency.
JPMorgan estimated the effort will add as much as $500 billion to what it would’ve provided anyway.
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon is launching the initiative amid trade brinkmanship between Washington and Beijing. Last week, President Donald Trump vowed to impose a 100% tariff on goods from China after it announced stricter export controls of items that use even traces of certain rare earths, as well as equipment and technology for processing them.
“It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing – all of which are essential for our national security,” Dimon said in a statement Monday announcing the bank’s target. “We need to act now.”
Dimon, 69, has become more outspoken about US security in recent years. The country relies too much on potential adversaries for critical military products, he wrote in a letter to shareholders in May, citing China specifically. In 2023, he wrote that US supply chains for critical products and materials “must be domestic or only open to completely friendly allies or partners.”
Beyond loans and direct investments, there are a variety of ways big investment banks can provide funding to industries without opening their own wallets. That can include handling stock or bond sales, or arranging third-party financing. JPMorgan said the $1.5 trillion target will include funding that the firm facilitates. It noted the initiative will involve its asset and wealth management arm, which oversees client investments.
“This is not philanthropy. This is 100% commercial,” Dimon said Monday on a conference call to discuss the announcement. “We are going to take our resources of research, bankers and investors and we are going to scour the United States and maybe the world for new opportunities.”
Last year, companywide, JPMorgan extended credit and raised capital totaling $2.8 trillion.
Amid the new initiative, the bank will make equity and venture capital investments of as much as $10 billion to help certain companies expand, innovate or accelerate strategic manufacturing. The firm said it will also advocate policies supporting those efforts.
Dimon said Monday that JPMorgan will hire an investment team as well as dedicated bankers “who can deal not with just the best companies in the world but governments.”
