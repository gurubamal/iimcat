--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The DMK on Monday said that there are chances for the cancellation of the Supreme Court’s decision for a CBI probe into the Karur stampede in which 41 people were killed.
The principal opposition party AIADMK termed the SC’s decision as “clearly a slap in the face for DMK” and the BJP welcomed the court order for central agency investigation.
DMK Rajya Sabha member and advocate P Wilson, who represented the Tamil Nadu government in the stampede case, said two people have informed the court that without their knowledge, their names had been used to file a petition.
The Supreme Court on Monday ordered a CBI probe into the Karur stampede and appointed former apex court judge Ajay Rastogi as head of a committee to monitor it.
A bench, comprising Justices J K Maheshwari and N V Anjaria, also criticised Justice N Senthilkumar of the Madras High Court for entertaining petitions on the September 27 stampede at actor Vijay’s rally and ordering an SIT probe.
Speaking to reporters in Delhi, Wilson said people are celebrating already, but there is a chance that the Supreme Court order can be cancelled if it is proved that the petitions are fraudulently filed.
“Tomorrow if this (two people’s petition) is proved, there is a chance that the order can be cancelled, as courts follow the doctrine, ‘fraud vitiates all solemn acts’,” he added.
He also said the SC had decided to let the one-member commission headed by former High Court Judge Justice Aruna Jagadeesan to continue its inquiry.
“The court has also ordered the transfer of the findings of the SIT investigation. This means the court has confidence in the investigation held so far. Otherwise, it could have asked for de novo review, that is, to start all over,” Wilson said.
Meanwhile, AIADMK spokesperson Kovai Sathyan said the SC’s decision is “clearly a slap in the face for DMK”.
“They were peddling narratives and lies instead of doing justice to the victims’ families. There were glaring deficiencies in the way DMK took forward the handling of the investigation in this case,” he told PIT Videos.
Tamil Nadu BJP former president K Annamalai said it is only proper that a “trained agency like CBI, which has handled many such cases should take over the investigation”.
He also said the BJP wanted a CBI inquiry from the beginning because there was no trust in the one-member commission constituted by the TN government.
“This is about the lives of 41 people. We need to get to the bottom of it. Is it the mistake of the organisers or the local administration or somebody in the crowd,” he told reporters here.
Naam Tamilar Katchi (NTK) chief coordinator Seeman said that the Supreme Court ordering a CBI probe into the Karur stampede was an insult to Tamil Nadu and its police force.
He also asked if the CBI officers are specially endowed.
“Our police didn’t even begin the investigation and how is it fair then to transfer the case to CBI? This is an insult to not just the police, but also the state’s autonomy,” Seeman told reporters in Chennai.
He also criticised the DMK-led government for readily handing over state matters to the Union government.
“We all fought very hard for state autonomy, but now the DMK is handing everything on a platter to the Centre. Be it CBI inquiry or caste census,” Seeman said.
The top court on October 10 reserved its order on a plea filed by Vijay’s political party and others.
The TVK has sought an independent investigation under the supervision of the Supreme Court, contending that a fair and impartial probe would not be possible if conducted solely by officers of the Tamil Nadu Police.
The TVK’s plea objected to the high court constituting a special investigation team (SIT) only with officers of the Tamil Nadu police. It alleged the possibility of a pre-planned conspiracy by some miscreants that led to the stampede.
The plea also took exception to the scathing remarks of the high court against the party and the actor-politician that they abandoned the place after the incident and did not express any remorse.

Title   : Vodafone Idea shares slide 2% after Supreme Court defers AGR plea hearing

VIL had filed a fresh petition challenging the Department of Telecommunications’ (DoT) demand of Rs 5,606 crore for the financial year 2016–17, seeking a direction for the DoT to "comprehensively re-assess and reconcile" all AGR dues for the period up to FY 2016–17, in line with the Deduction Verification Guidelines dated February 3, 2020.
The Supreme Court’s deferral follows earlier setbacks for Vodafone Idea and other telecom majors. Earlier this year, the apex court had rejected petitions from VIL and Bharti Airtel seeking rectification of alleged errors in the 2021 order calculating AGR dues.
Government signals possible settlement
Despite the legal roadblocks, the Centre has indicated efforts are underway to find a resolution. Last month, the government told the apex court that "some solution may be required" for Vodafone Idea’s petition. Bloomberg reported on October 6, citing sources, that India is considering a one-time settlement of its longstanding AGR dues from Vodafone Group Plc’s local venture, potentially through a waiver of interest and penalties, followed by concessions on the principal.Officials are reportedly drafting the framework while evaluating measures to prevent legal challenges from other telecom operators with AGR obligations, according to the Bloomberg report. The total dispute amounts to nearly Rs 2 lakh crore.

The delayed hearing adds to the uncertainty surrounding Vodafone Idea’s balance sheet and investor sentiment. As the Supreme Court sets the next date for October 27, investors will be watching closely for any signs of a concrete resolution that could reshape Vodafone Idea’s financial outlook.

Title   : Supreme Court refuses to hear Asian Paints’ plea against competition commission probe, allows firm to withdraw petition

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Delhi: In a setback for Asian Paints Ltd, the Supreme Court on Monday refused to entertain the company’s plea challenging an antitrust investigation launched by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) following a complaint by Grasim Industries’ decorative paints arm, Birla Opus.
A bench of Justice J.K. Maheshwari and Justice Vijay Bishnoi, after hearing the plea, stated that they were “not inclined to entertain this”, but allowed Asian Paints, India's largest paintmaker, to withdraw its petition at the company’s request.
The company had approached the apex court after the Bombay High Court, in September 2025, dismissed its petition and upheld the CCI’s decision to investigate alleged abuse of dominance in the decorative paints segment.
Asian Paints had argued that it faced repeated scrutiny whenever a new player entered the market and that the regulator’s actions were procedurally flawed.
During the Supreme Court hearing, senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi and Neeraj Kishan Kaul argued that Grasim Industries' complaint was substantially similar to a prior complaint filed by JSW Paints in 2022, which had been investigated and dismissed.
They contended that the company should not face repeated investigations for essentially the same claims. “The earlier complaint and this complaint are identical in their reasoning. My market reputation is at stake. Public perception is at stake. Damage is being done to me,” Kaul said.
Rohatgi highlighted the prolonged nature of such probes: “One pain fellow will come for two years. The investigation went on for two years. It's a very detailed investigation. It's not like a suit that happens in two years. Three years. It ends. Then in the fourth year, another chap will come. Another four years will go by. After this is over, another chap will come.”
The court, however, clarified that the JSW Paints case did not grant perpetual immunity. “This inquiry conducted on a complaint of JSW would not give you a certificate that you are fair and everything,” the court said.
The legal tussle began in mid-2025, when Birla Opus, the paints division of Aditya Birla’s group, filed a complaint with the CCI alleging that Asian Paints pressured dealers not to stock Birla Opus products, offered preferential incentives to select dealers, and obstructed access to logistics and warehousing for competitors.
The CCI initiated an investigation into Asian Paints on 1 July 2025. Asian Paints, in a 3 July stock exchange filing, said it was reviewing the order and would take appropriate legal recourse.
Subsequently, Asian Paints approached the Bombay High Court. The company also contended that it was not given a hearing or a proper right to respond.
The Bombay High Court rejected the company’s plea, noting that preliminary inquiries under Section 26(1) of the Competition Act, 2002, are administrative and do not require a hearing. It said new facts or evidence can be investigated, and prior dismissal does not grant perpetual immunity. It further dismissed claims of procedural flaws, stating that the CCI had acted within its legal powers.
In response to a query, Asian Paints said it respects the judicial process and will cooperate with the regulatory proceedings.
"The appeal focused solely on the interpretation of law which came by way of amendment in 2023. In any case, the company will address the CCI investigation and appropriately respond to all queries," the paintmaker added.
Asian Paints also said that it remains committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and fair competition.
Asian Paints holds over 50% market share in India’s decorative paints segment, ahead of Berger Paints, Kansai Nerolac, JSW Paints, and Birla Opus. The paintmaker’s June-quarter profit fell by 6% to ₹1,099.77 crore.
Analysts at Elara Capital, in a 6 October research note, said demand for paints remained weak due to extended monsoons and heightened competitive intensity, projecting sales growth of around 1% for Asian Paints and 2% for Berger, with volume growth in the mid-single digits.
Since its launch in April 2024, Birla Opus has shaken up the paints market, and competition has heated up further after JSW Paints acquired Dutch paintmaker Akzo Nobel’s India business in June.
Shares of Asian Paints ended flat on Monday at ₹2,343 on the National Stock Exchange in an overall weak market.
