The adjustment in pricing comes just ahead of the peak festive season, during which demand for food delivery is projected to rise sharply.
The timing also follows a similar move by its competitor Swiggy, which recently raised its own platform fee to Rs 14 from Rs 12 in select pin codes, inclusive of Goods and Services Tax (GST).
The fee hike, according to sources, is likely to be rolled back once demand stabilizes.
Both companies continue to push heavily into their respective quick commerce verticals.
Zomato and Swiggy ramped up investments in this segment during the April–June quarter, eyeing faster delivery timelines and a broader assortment of instant groceries to retain and grow their customer base.
Zomato’s parent company reported a 90% year-on-year (YoY) decline in consolidated net profit for the April–June quarter. The profit for the quarter fell to Rs 25 crore, compared to Rs 253 crore in the same quarter last year. However, revenue for the same period rose 70%.
Meanwhile, Swiggy’s financials reflected increased spending as well. The company’s losses doubled during the quarter to Rs 1,197 crore, largely due to higher investments in its Instamart vertical. Swiggy’s operating revenue rose 54% year-on-year to Rs 4,961 crore for the quarter.
The competitive landscape is also evolving rapidly. Zomato and Swiggy now face fresh competition from Ownly, a new food delivery service launched by ride-hailing platform Rapido. The service is currently operational in the Koramangala, HSR, and BTM Layout areas of Bengaluru.
Ownly differentiates itself by offering a more restaurant-friendly commission model. While Zomato and Swiggy reportedly charge commissions in the range of 16% to 30% from restaurant partners, Ownly plans to keep its commission range between 8% and 15%. The company is in the process of scaling up operations and expanding its reach beyond its initial launch zones.
