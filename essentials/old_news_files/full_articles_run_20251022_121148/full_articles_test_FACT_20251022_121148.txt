--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Tamil Nadu government plans to amend an archaic law -Tamil Nadu Factories Rules, 1950 - to enable women to work in about 20 operations listed as ‘dangerous.’ Out of all the women working in factories across India in the organised sector, nearly 42 per cent are from Tamil Nadu, and the amendment will increase the share further, said government sources.
At present, the law aims to lift longstanding prohibitions under Section 87 of the Factories Act, 1948, which previously barred women from employment in sectors like chemical and metal processes and high-risk manufacturing. The processes are deemed hazardous due to risks of bodily injury, poisoning, or disease.
“However, this was an archaic prohibition, which we thought of removing it from the rule books,” said a government official. “We have not done any study on what could be the incremental addition to the women ‘s employment through this amendment,” he added.
Experts hail progressive reform with safety and consent safeguards
Rishi Agrawal, CEO and Co-founder of Teamlease Regtech, said the amendment would allow women to participate in these roles (with safeguards, such as prohibiting pregnant women), while also requiring written consent for night shifts. This aligns with broader national efforts to enhance gender equality in labour laws, as highlighted in recent central government advisories urging states to deregulate “women-unfriendly” restrictions. The move is progressive but builds on TN’s existing strengths in female factory employment.
The draft notification does not enumerate all the operations; however, based on the Tamil Nadu Factories Rules and the amendment’s description, it covers 20 hazardous processes previously prohibited for women. These are drawn from the Schedules to the Factories Act and state rules, focusing on Chemical and Metal Processes, Extraction & Solvent-Based, High-Risk Manufacturing, Material Handling & Finishing and Environmental Hazards, he said.
Could add 30,000–40,000 new female workers, say estimates
The World Bank has noted Tamil Nadu’s pool of working women (urban and rural) is about 1.6 million, and many remain untapped. Of these, roughly 6–7 lakh already work in registered factories. If women begin filling even a fraction of the vacancies in the newly opened 20 processes, it could mean tens of thousands of new women employees. These jobs would span manufacturing units in Tamil Nadu, helping the state meet its goals under initiatives like the new $150 million Women’s Employment & Safety program.
If the new notification raises women’s share in these industries by just a few points, that could translate to thousands more women on factory floors. For example, adding 5 per cent more to the current status would mean on the order of 30,000 to 40,000 new female factory workers, he said.
