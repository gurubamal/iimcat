Two-time Olympic medalist javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra has been conferred the honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Territorial Army, joining the exclusive league of sporting legends like MS Dhoni and Kapil Dev who have been similarly recognised for their contributions beyond the field.
Defence Minister Rajnath Singh bestowed the insignia on Chopra at a formal pipping ceremony held in New Delhi on Wednesday. The event was attended by Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi and senior officials, marking a proud moment not just for Indian athletics but also for the armed forces.
“Neeraj Chopra is the epitome of perseverance, patriotism, and the Indian spirit of striving for excellence,” said Singh, praising the 27-year-old for inspiring generations within both the sporting world and the military.
Chopra, who originally joined the Indian Army as a Naib Subedar in August 2016, quickly rose through the ranks, becoming Subedar in 2021 and Subedar Major in 2022. The honorary commission, granted by President Droupadi Murmu on April 16, 2025, recognises his extraordinary achievements and his symbolic representation of national pride.
Born in Khandra village in Haryana’s Panipat district, Chopra made history by clinching India’s first Olympic gold in athletics at the Tokyo 2020 Games. He went on to win a silver at the Paris 2024 Olympics and claimed gold at the 2023 World Athletics Championships. His personal best of 90.23 meters, achieved in 2025, is a landmark in Indian athletics.
Beyond the Olympic podium, Chopra has consistently delivered top performances, securing multiple golds at the Asian Games, Commonwealth Games, and Diamond League events.
His accolades include some of India’s highest sporting and civilian honours — the Padma Shri, Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award, Arjuna Award, as well as the Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
Now as Lt Col (Hony) Neeraj Chopra, he continues to serve as a beacon of excellence — both in the sporting arena and in his service to the nation.
