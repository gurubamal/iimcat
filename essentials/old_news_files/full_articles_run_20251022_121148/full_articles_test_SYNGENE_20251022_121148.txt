Contract research, development, and manufacturing organisation (CRDMO), Syngene International is adding a GMP bioconjugation suite at its commercial biologics facility [Unit 3] in Bengaluru.
The new capability will offer end-to-end services for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) – from discovery through to GMP manufacturing, and is set to be operational within this financial year.
The OEB-5-rated suite will accelerate ADC development timelines by enabling both Monoclonal Antibodies (mAb) production and GMP bioconjugation at a single site.
The conjugation facility will also support a range of advanced conjugates and related modalities.
Alex Del Priore, Head - LM CDMO, Syngene International. “By integrating bioconjugation capabilities with our commercial-scale biologics, payload, and linker production units in Bengaluru, we can significantly compress development timelines and offer a unique, end-to-end pathway from early discovery through to GMP manufacturing.”
Building on a decade of experience in ADC discovery and with proven expertise in handling high-potency payloads, linkers, and mAbs across well-established, GMP-compliant facilities, Syngene is scaling its capabilities to support clinical programs and plans to develop commercial-scale capabilities in the future.
Additionally, the laboratories will offer process development, analytical characterization, and scale-up for both early- and late-stage programs.
The shares of Syngene closed at Rs 641.90 , down by 0.31 per cent on the BSE.
