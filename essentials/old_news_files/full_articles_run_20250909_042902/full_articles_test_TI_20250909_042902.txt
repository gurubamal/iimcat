IIM Calcutta has secured the 41st position globally in the Financial Times Masters in Management Rankings 2025 for its flagship two-year MBA programme, climbing 15 places from its 56th rank last year.
Among the Indian Institutes of Management, IIM Calcutta stood third overall, a statement said on Monday.
“This elevation in ranking is a reflection of the quality of education provided by the institute, and the final outcome of successful employment among the 2-Year MBA programme’s alumni,” IIM Calcutta said in the statement.
Commenting on the 2025 Rankings, Alok Kumar Rai, Director, IIM Calcutta, said, “The FT MIM Ranking for 2025 is a reiteration of the leadership positions that IIM Calcutta holds in the global management education landscape. With the internationalization of our curriculum over the years and some of the best faculty from across the world, our offerings are curated to address the needs of the dynamic business environment. As a result, we have been able to create a pool of ethical and responsible leaders across domains.”
This ranking will help the institute network more closely with the top B-schools across the globe, Rai said.
FT MIM ranking is important because it provides global, data-driven benchmarks for business schools, influencing decisions for prospective students, recruiters, and funding bodies.
“The rankings, which focus on factors like graduate salary growth, career progression, research, and international diversity, lend credibility to schools and offer insight into their return on investment. This makes them a valuable tool for evaluating program quality, attracting top talent, and guiding strategic improvements in business education,” the statement added.
