PCBL Chemical, India’s largest carbon black manufacturer, is eyeing to double its revenue to ₹16,000 crore over the next five years, driven by capacity expansion across product segments.
The company, the sixth largest carbon black producer globally, is targeting 50 per cent capacity addition over next five years across all product segments, according to a presentation made by the company on Monday. It is undergoing a brownfield expansion in Tamil Nadu, and planning a greenfield project in Andhra Pradesh.
The company has plans to expand specialty chemical portfolio towards high margin products including super-conductive grades and battery chemicals. It is also building an integrated battery chemicals ecosystem through Nano Silicon, Acetylene Black and Super Conductive Grades.
PCBL Chemical, a part of RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group, clocked a revenue of ₹8,400 crore in FY25. In the last financial year, its Ebitda margin was at 16.5 per cent. The company is eyeing an Ebitda margin of 24 per cent by 2030.
The company is looking to grow its Ebita by 200 per cent to around ₹4,000 crore in the next five years.
During the first quarter earnings conference call in July, the company said the first phase of its carbon black brownfield expansion of 30,000 mtpa at PCBL Tamil Nadu commenced trial runs. The second phase, comprising an additional 60,000 mtpa, along with 12 MW power capacity, is expected to be commissioned by the end of this financial year.
“We are in the process of completing the acquisition of 116 acres at Naidupeta in Andhra Pradesh for a greenfield carbon black project. This new facility will focus on producing Rubber Black and Performance Chemicals. Capex at this site is expected to commence once we obtain environmental clearance in this year,” said Kaushik Roy, Managing Director, during the earnings conference call.
“We are also planning to set up a new line of specialty black of 20,000 mtpa capacity, which is expected to be ready over the next 3-4 quarters. This would take our total specialty black capacity to 1,32,000 mtpa. This line will be coming up in Mundra,” Roy said.
Notably, the company is the fourth largest specialty black player globally.
