According to sources cited by CNBC-TV18, the proposed transaction has a floor price of Rs 7,600 per share, which is at a marginal discount to the stock’s last traded price of Rs 7,777.50. The deal structure and pricing are likely to attract market interest, particularly from institutional buyers looking for high-value block allocations in a fundamentally strong midcap engineering play.
Currently, Kunjal Patel holds a 37.8% stake in the company. A successful sale of 7.88 lakh shares would reduce his holding significantly and may alter promoter holding dynamics going forward. Importantly, the deal comes with lock-up conditions—the full portion of shares sold through the block deal will carry a two-year lock-in period, while any unsold portion will be subject to a one-year lock-in.
Voltamp Transformers is a Baroda-based company and is mainly into the manufacturing of various types of oil-filled power & distribution transformers of various classes.
