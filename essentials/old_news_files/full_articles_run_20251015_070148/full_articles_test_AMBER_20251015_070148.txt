--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Coal India: A Safe Long-Term Bet
Osho Krishan said, “Coal India is a positive counter for long-term investors. It’s hovering around 370–380, with a dividend yield of 6.5%. Support is near 340, and the first target is 460. If it breaches that, it could test 500. One can look to accumulate at current levels.”
Medium-Term Favorites: Eternal and CDSL
Arpit Beriwal highlighted thematic opportunities: “Eternal has a strong setup, especially with the festival season coming up. Stop loss around 305, upside towards 400–444 over three to six months. In the capital market space, CDSL has a solid base around 1,580–1,600. Risk-reward looks good, with targets of 1,700–1,800 and stop loss at 1,500.”
Osho Krishan added on CDSL: “CDSL is on the verge of a breakout. First target is 1,800, then 2,000 if breached. Strong support is at 1,400, so stop loss should be 1,400.”
Auto Picks: Bajaj Auto Shows Promise
Kunal Bothra said, “Bajaj Auto looks attractive for the medium term. It’s breaking key short-term averages above 9,000. Target is 10,000, stop loss 8,500. The stock should catch up with other outperforming peers.”
High-Risk Rockets: Amber Enterprises and Hindustan Zinc
Arpit Beriwal on Amber Enterprises: “Amber Enterprises has broken out above 7,400 and is holding life-high levels. There’s room for 15–20% upside. Stop loss 7,500, target 9,000–10,000. Polycab also looks strong with upside to 8,000–8,500, stop loss 7,200.”
Kunal Bothra on Hindustan Zinc: “Hindustan Zinc could benefit from silver prices. Current price around 500 offers decent upside to 600, stop at 450, and it may enter a multi-year uptrend.”
With a mix of stable dividend-yielding bets, medium-term thematic plays, and high-risk high-reward options, investors have multiple avenues to tailor portfolios to their risk appetite.
