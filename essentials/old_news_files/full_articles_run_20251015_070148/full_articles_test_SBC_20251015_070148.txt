Rubicon Research Ltd – Subscription: 109x | GMP: 30%
Rubicon Research’s Rs 1,377 crore IPO drew massive institutional interest, led by strong US generics exposure and rising profitability. Its stellar subscription and 30% grey market premium suggest a healthy listing pop, making it the week’s most awaited debut.
