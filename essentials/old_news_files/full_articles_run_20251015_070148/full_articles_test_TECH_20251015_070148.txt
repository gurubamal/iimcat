--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tech Mahindra reported 4.4 per cent on-year fall in Q2 net profit owing to a one-time exceptional gain for sale of land last year, while revenue increased 5 per cent.
Its EBITDA for the quarter rose 23.8 per cent on year.
The software company reported net profit of $1,194.5 crore on revenue of $13,994 crore.
Sequentially its net profit rose 4.7 per cent sequentially with revenue increasing 4.8 per cent boosted by positive performance in the IT and BPS sectors. EBITDA rose 12 per cent on a quarterly basis to ₹ 2,168 crore.
Speaking on the quarterly results, Mohit Joshi, CEO and Managing Director, Tech Mahindra, said, “We delivered broad-based growth this quarter, reflecting the strength of our strategy and execution.”
Rohit Anand, Chief Financial Officer, Tech Mahindra, said, “This quarter marks the eighth consecutive period of margin expansion, driven by operational efficiency and disciplined execution. Our deal TCV is up 57 per cent year on year on LTM (last twelve months) basis, supported by strong deal conversions. The board has approved a dividend of ₹15 per share reflecting our continued focus on shareholder value.”
In US dollar, net profit increased 28 per cent annually and revenue was down 0.2 per cent. EBITDA margins went up 254 basis points to 12.1 per cent.
Discretionary spends
Anand said clients are looking at consolidation and cost take out projects. From a sector perspective, the company saw good growth in aerospace, consumer products and retail. In the telco sector discretionary spend has not returned in a big way.
“Most of the spend that we are seeing is either consolidation or in areas like autonomous operations that are supposed to lead to significant efficiency benefits in the future. Maybe the discretionary spend we are seeing is on the data side across industries where clients are looking to build out data stacks to get a lot more of the benefit of this AI transformation opportunity,” he said. Meanwhile, Joshi said he expects discretionary spend to come back over time.
Talking about must-have clients, the company secured 21 accounts in the first two quarters of this fiscal year. Of these, 17 have already generated over $1 million in revenue each.
Communications hit by industry stress
Communications and Technology, Media and Entertainment sectors declined in terms of performance, both sequentially and annually. However, in terms of communications, the company said yet the segment remains largely stable.
“Our largest client has stabilized its spend and delivered growth above the company average this quarter,” said Joshi, adding how the company is partnering with a key European telco client is set to launch their large telco model to bolster their service experience centre and building a data-driven ecosystem. He attributed the decline in the sector to the steep drops for all over the past two years, driven by stress faced by the telecom industry such as heavy debt load and rolling ARPU rates.
Reductions in hitech sector
In terms of hi-tech, the company expects the semiconductor space to grow for the rest of the year. In the first half of the year, Tech Mahindra was impacted by a client decision to dramatically ramp down a huge portion of their business. While citing ‘interesting new wins” in the current quarter, Tech Mahindra also stated some spending cuts and headcount reductions among some software players. Company estimated that clients are doing this for cost control reasons rather than a significant reduction in businesses.
Regarding the India AI Mission, Tech Mahindra will partner to develop an indigenous, sovereign, large language model with one trillion parameters and hyper-large LLMs and offer talent rather than data center investments.
Other verticals
BFSI grew 3.8 per cent sequentially and increased 6.2 per cent annually, acquiring a partnership with JP Morgan Payments Systems. Manufacturing grew 5.3 per cent sequentially and 5.2 per cent on a yearly basis. Largest client has stablised spend, said Joshi, attributing the performance to the demand for smart manufacturing, predictive maintenance and digital twins.
“Automotive has been broadly stable this quarter. However, we remain cautious particularly in the commercial segment which continues to face headwinds while the passenger vehicle segment shows some early signs of stabilization,” said Joshi. In terms of the logistics sector, Tech Mahindra reported strong tailwinds driven by e-commerce expansion, automation and warehousing, last-mile delivery optimization.
Q2 headcount
The company reported an IT headcount of 78,528 employees, down 2,090 year on year. The IT LTM attrition is at 12.8 per cent versus 12.6 per cent last quarter. The company officials described this as a a marginal reduction in the workforce.
H1B visa
Regarding the visa developments, Joshi said roughly only one percent of the roughly 150,000 people in the company are on H1B visa. The huge majority of the US workforce is either citizens or people on green cards.
“Our dependence on H1s is limited. Obviously, any change to this program will have an impact on us. We’re thinking is how do we make sure that we continue the work that we’ve done to build a stronger employer brand name in the US? How do we make sure that we’re able to firewall and retain our top employees in the US and other markets as we start seeing attrition, poaching? We do have a network of delivery capabilities across the world, including in the Americas, in Brazil, in Mexico, in Canada. How do we make sure we’re able to leverage,” said Joshi.
Geographically, Americas declined 2.7 per cent annually while Europe increased 5.5 per cent during the same time. Rest of the world declined 0.5 per cent. When asked, Joshi said the company estimated stabilization and growth in the second half of the year from a macro perspective.

Title   : Tech Mahindra posts modest revenue growth, but margins hit new high

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tech Mahindra Ltd kicked off the second half of the fiscal year with modest sequential growth and outlined a cautious future, even as it neared the half-way mark of its three-year revival plan during which its operating margins doubled.
The Pune-based IT services company reported $1.59 billion in revenue for the July-September period, up 1.4% sequentially but down 0.2% on a yearly basis. Most of the growth came from manufacturers, which made up three-fifths of the company’s incremental revenue of $22 million. Its net profit rose 1.5% to $135 million.
The company’s management said the macroeconomic environment was stabilizing, but concerns existed.
“From a macro perspective, we see the macro as stabilizing and maybe improving in parts. But it is still fragile. There is unlikely to be any sort of V-shaped recovery in spend, but we do see a stabilization and, hopefully, growth in the second half of the year,” said Mohit Joshi, chief executive of Tech Mahindra, during the company’s post-earnings press conference on Tuesday.
Tech Mahindra shares closed 1.2% higher at ₹1,468.15 apiece on the BSE on Tuesday.
The company’s mixed signals were in contrast to two of its peers.
A day before, India's third-largest software services firm HCL Technologies Ltd’s management said that the macro environment was more or less unchanged. This was in contrast to larger peer Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, which said that there is “lingering uncertainty” in the broader economic environment.
TCS and HCL respectively ended the second quarter with $7.47 billion and $3.64 billion in revenue, up 0.6% and 2.8% sequentially.
Both the larger companies also made big-bang AI announcements. While Mumbai-based TCS announced plans to invest upwards of $6 billion over a six-year period in building and running a 1 GW data centre, Noida-based HCLTech became the first company among Indian IT’s Big Five to announce revenue from the new technology. It got $100 million in AI-led revenue last quarter.
Tech Mahindra, on the other hand, has been placing its bets on large language models.
“We are partnering to develop an indigenous, sovereign, large language model with 1 trillion parameters, the significant technical milestone that places it among the largest AI models under development globally,” said Joshi.
However, he did not reveal the investment details, and queries on project timelines went unanswered.
Instead, the management said the company was investing in talent rather than in data centres.
“The investment, from our perspective, is largely, sort of in terms of talent, rather than, you know, rather than a significant amount of data center investments, right? So, it is largely in terms of partnership and talent, that's where our investment is coming in as of now,” said Joshi, in response to Mint’s question during the press conference
The company ended the September quarter with 12.1% in operating margins, up 100 basis points from the previous quarter. Its management attributed this to “improved productivity, initiatives around fixed price projects, some volume growth, savings from selling, general and administrative expenses, amongst others. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
This jump in profitability comes as a shot in the arm for its management, which seeks to increase its operating margin to 15% by March 2027, and grow its revenue faster than peers as part of a three-year roadmap called Project Fortius, which was announced last year.
While the revenue growth has not crossed 3% in the last year, the margins have doubled from 6.1% in April last year, when it announced its margin expansion plan.
At least one analyst expressed confidence in the company’s plans.
“New deal TCV (total contract value) at $816 million was also at its highest-ever level since Q4FY22. Healthy growth coupled with continued margin expansion reinforces confidence in the company to deliver on its three-year turnaround plan outlined at the end of FY24,” said Manik Taneja, executive director for IT services at Axis Capital.
Tech Mahindra, which does not give quarterly or yearly outlook, said that tech spends for IT projects would follow.
“As far as the Indian IT industry is concerned, I do feel that the industry has a very sustainable business model, has shown resilience across economic cycles. But equally, it has had portions of hyper growth, like we saw during Covid, and periods of very slow growth, like in this period. But even in this timeframe, I feel the industry, especially Tech Mahindra, has shown its resilience,” said Joshi.
He added that “as the overall economic activity across the globe picks up, we do feel that tech spend will follow.”
For now, its results exceeded analyst expectations. According to a Bloomberg poll of 30 analysts, Tech Mahindra was expected to report $1.55 billion in revenue in the second quarter.
Another bright point was its profitability, which has been increasing for eight consecutive quarters.
The company added 4,197 people last quarter to end with 152,714 employees. HCL added more than 3,000 employees, while TCS cut its employee count by more than 19,000 people.

“We are pleased to report a robust set of results for the quarter and the announcement of our bonus issue on the occasion of 25 years of Thyrocare, coinciding with the auspicious occasion of Diwali. These numbers underscore our continued focus on operational excellence, network expansion, and value-driven diagnostics.
