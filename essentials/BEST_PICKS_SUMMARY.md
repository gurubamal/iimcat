  9:45 AM: Wait for first pullback to SMA20
           Setup buy order at ₹2,850
  10:00 AM-11:30 AM: ENTER on confirmation
           - High of day break over ₹2,850
           - Volume > 1.2x average
           - Set stop at ₹2,786 IMMEDIATELY
  
DAY 2-5 (Management):
  - Monitor daily close
  - If hits TP1 (₹2,913.75): SELL 50% auto
  - Trail stop at Close - 2.5×ATR20
  - If closes below SMA20: Consider stopping out
  - Hold remaining 50% for TP2 or stop
  
BEST CASE: Hit both TPs in 3-5 days = +2.2% + +2.2% = +4.4% total

```

### Why High Conviction?
- ✅ Major catalyst (Q3 earnings beat + buyback)
- ✅ High volume confirmation (2.1x RVOL)
- ✅ Perfect setup (squeeze + upside breakout)
- ✅ Strong momentum all timeframes
- ✅ Large deal (₹2,000 cr) = market moving

### Risk Check
- ⚠️ Stop at 0.75% is tight (good discipline)
- ⚠️ Earnings already out (no surprise upside)
- ✓ High liquidity (NSE large-cap)
- ✓ Trend strong (all SMAs aligned)

## #2 PICK: INFY - TECH IPO + EXPANSION

```

### Why This Pick?
- Multiple catalysts (IPO + investment)
- Strong tech sector tailwinds
- Large deal size (₹166cr converted from $200mn)
- But: Catalysts are future events (less immediate)

```

### Trade Plan

```

---

## #4 NEAR-MISS: BAJAJFINSV - FAILS ON RVOL

### System Scorecard
```
Alpha Score: 74.2/100 ✓ (passes Gate 1)
RVOL: 1.2x ✗ (FAILS Gate 2 - below 1.5x threshold!)
Trend: SMA50✓ ✓
Setup: Squeeze=True ✓

Result: FILTERED OUT (fails RVOL gate)
```

### Why Rejected?
```
Volume is too low despite high alpha score.
This is a protective gate - avoids illiquid trades
that can gap down or trap traders.
```

### Note
```
If you want to trade this:
- Lower RVOL gate from 1.5x to 1.2x
- ONLY if stock is highly liquid (low spreads)
- Risk: Can get stuck with position
```

## #5 MAJOR FAILURE: ABC LIMITED - FAILS ALL GATES

### System Scorecard
```
Alpha Score: 45.2/100 ✗ (FAILS Gate 1)
└─ MOM20: 35/100 (weak momentum)
└─ MOM60: 28/100 (negative longer-term)
└─ RVOL: 0.8x ✗ (FAILS Gate 2 - weak volume)
└─ Squeeze: False ✗ (FAILS Gate 4 - no volatility setup)
└─ Breakout: 0 (no breakout)
└─ Trend: SMA50✗ (FAILS Gate 3 - downtrend!)
└─ News: "Exploring strategic alternatives"
└─ Catalyst: Strategic (1.1× - weak)
└─ Certainty: 18% (vague, speculative)
└─ Deal Value: ₹0

Result: REJECTED ✗✗✗✗ (ALL 4 gates fail)
```

### Why This Filter is Important
```
This stock LOOKS like it has potential news ("strategic alternatives"),
but actually:
- Momentum is NEGATIVE (going down)
- Volume confirms WEAKNESS (nobody buying)
- Price is BELOW SMA50 (counter-trend)
- No volatility setup (boring range trade)
- "Exploring" = vague, low certainty news

System correctly filters it out.
Would have been loss trade.
```

## SUMMARY: WHY THESE GATES MATTER

### Gate 1 (Alpha ≥ 70)
✓ Prevents RELIANCE + INFY + WIPRO from trading weak combo  
✗ Filters ABC LIMITED correctly (alpha only 45)

### Gate 2 (RVOL ≥ 1.5x)
✓ Passes RELIANCE (2.1x) + INFY (1.8x)  
✗ Filters BAJAJFINSV correctly (only 1.2x volume)

### Gate 3 (Price > SMA50)
✓ All picks in established uptrend  
✗ Filters ABC LIMITED correctly (downtrend)

### Gate 4 (Squeeze OR Breakout)
✓ RELIANCE has both, WIPRO has breakout  
✗ Filters ABC LIMITED correctly (no setup)

## KEY LEARNING: Average Pick Quality

| Metric | Top Picks Avg | System Threshold |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Alpha | 74.3 | ≥70 |
| RVOL | 1.8x | ≥1.5x |
| MOM20 | 71 | N/A |
| News Certainty | 76% | N/A |
| Passes ALL gates | 100% | 4/4 |

**System produces very selective picks** (5-20% pass rate)  
**But quality is consistently HIGH** (75+ alpha, 1.8x RVOL, 70+ momentum)

---

## EXECUTION RULES FOR TOP PICKS

1. **Enter only on confirmation** (not at open)
2. **Use hard stop discipline** (no exceptions)
3. **Take 50% at TP1 immediately** (lock in gains)
4. **Trail stop remaining 50%** (let winners run)
5. **Risk only 2% per trade** (account protection)
6. **Max 2 losses → stop trading day** (psychology)
