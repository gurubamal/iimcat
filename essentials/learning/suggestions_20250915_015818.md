## Suggested Fixes
- High share of 'live updates' (8/25). Suggest down-weight live-update pages by -30%.
- Many picks missing exact ticker in title (6/25). Increase name penalty by -0.05.
- Average duplicate factor 1.16. Suggest increasing dedup exponent by +0.1.
- 'ACC' matched 'Dev Accelerator'. Add entity mapping to ensure ACC Ltd only.
- Ticker 'GLOBAL' likely Healthcare Global (HCG). Add mapping to HCG and ensure valid NSE tickers filter.
- Block deals observed. Consider a small positive event bonus for 'Block deal'.
