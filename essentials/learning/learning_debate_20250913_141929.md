## Debate & Recommendations — Run 2 (2025-09-13T11:57:43)

This section captures a reasoning-heavy analysis contrasting latest picks with prior learnings, proposing concrete, data-driven adjustments.

Key observations:
- No-exact-ticker ratio: 24.0% (target < 25%)
- Avg duplication factor: 1.24 (target <= 1.10)
- Median magnitude: ~₹0.0 Cr; correlation with score proxy: -0.07
- Event distribution (latest): General:13, Order/contract:5, IPO/listing:3, Results/metrics:1, Management:1, M&A/JV:1, Dividend/return:1

Recommendations for next run (config deltas):
- dedup_exponent: delta 0.1 (bounds: -inf..2.0) — Avg duplicate factor 1.24; strengthen 1/dups^alpha to reduce duplication bias.

Implementation notes:
- name_factor_missing: increases penalty when ticker not in title; improves entity precision.
- dedup_exponent: strengthens 1/dups^alpha so duplicated headlines don't dominate.
- magnitude_cap: allows larger ₹ deals to contribute slightly more to ranking.
- source_bonus: tiny multipliers to reflect source reliability; remains conservative.

This section captures a reasoning-heavy analysis contrasting latest picks with prior learnings, proposing concrete, data-driven adjustments.

Key observations:
- No-exact-ticker ratio: 31.4% (target < 25%)
- Avg duplication factor: 1.40 (target <= 1.10)
- Median magnitude: ~₹0.0 Cr; correlation with score proxy: -0.04
- Event distribution (latest): General:22, Order/contract:6, IPO/listing:3, Results/metrics:1, Management:1, M&A/JV:1, Dividend/return:1

Recommendations for next run (config deltas):
- name_factor_missing: delta -0.05 (bounds: 0.5..inf) — No exact ticker in 31.4% of picks; increase penalty to force entity precision.
- dedup_exponent: delta 0.1 (bounds: -inf..2.0) — Avg duplicate factor 1.40; strengthen 1/dups^alpha to reduce duplication bias.

Implementation notes:
- name_factor_missing: increases penalty when ticker not in title; improves entity precision.

## Debate & Recommendations — Run 6 (2025-09-13T12:28:47)

Unreliable tickers (fake rises > successes):
- RETAIL: successes=0, fake_rises=1
- HINDALCO: successes=0, fake_rises=1
- APOLLO: successes=0, fake_rises=1
- WEL: successes=0, fake_rises=1
- BEL: successes=0, fake_rises=1

This section captures a reasoning-heavy analysis contrasting latest picks with prior learnings, proposing concrete, data-driven adjustments.

Key observations:
- No-exact-ticker ratio: 50.0% (target < 25%)
- Avg duplication factor: 1.10 (target <= 1.10)
- Median magnitude: ~₹0.0 Cr; correlation with score proxy: -0.09
- Event distribution (latest): General:15, IPO/listing:2, Results/metrics:1, Order/contract:1, Dividend/return:1

Recommendations for next run (config deltas):
- name_factor_missing: delta -0.05 (bounds: 0.5..inf) — No exact ticker in 50.0% of picks; increase penalty to force entity precision.
- ticker_penalty: {'RETAIL': -0.05, 'HINDALCO': -0.05, 'APOLLO': -0.05, 'WEL': -0.05, 'BEL': -0.05} — Flagged as unreliable (fake rises exceeded successes). Apply small penalties.

Implementation notes:
- name_factor_missing: increases penalty when ticker not in title; improves entity precision.
- dedup_exponent: strengthens 1/dups^alpha so duplicated headlines don't dominate.
- magnitude_cap: allows larger ₹ deals to contribute slightly more to ranking.
