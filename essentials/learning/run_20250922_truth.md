# Run 2025-09-22 — Same‑Day Outcome and Reasons

This note documents what happened with today’s picks, why they behaved that way, and concrete refinements to our process.

## Summary (present‑day check)
- ITC: −0.95% vs previous close
  - Event: General (management commentary)
  - Title: "ITC Chairman: Nepal investment plans on track despite turbulence, uncertainties"
  - Source: thehindubusinessline
  - News certainty: 0.350 | Trust: 0.395
- WIPRO: −2.22% vs previous close
  - Event: General (policy/ADR move context)
  - Title: "Infosys, Wipro ADRs decline up to 4% amid Trump’s proposal for $100,000 annual H‑1B visa fee"
  - Source: economictimes
  - News certainty: 0.350 | Trust: 0.395

Data source (auto‑saved): `outputs/feedback_live_20250922_150053.csv`

## Why it happened
- General‑event drag: Both stories are classified as General. Without a concrete catalyst (order/listing/approval/contract), same‑day upside probability is low.
- Policy headwind (WIPRO): The proposed H‑1B fee is a negative regulatory cue; same‑day downside is consistent with content.
- No magnitude signal: No ₹ amount or quantified impact; magnitude component is weak, further reducing immediacy.
- Source quality OK but non‑decisive: Reputable outlets, yet the narrative is informational vs actionable.

## What this means (truth for today)
- Neither item qualifies as a “Best Buy Today” signal. They are context signals, not trade catalysts.
- The observed moves (small negative for ITC, larger negative for WIPRO) align with event classes and lack of quantified positives.

## Refinements (applied in pipeline)
- Mandatory live feedback: Present‑day returns, news certainty, and trust are now recorded each run (`live_feedback` table, CSV snapshot).
- Gating in assessment: The main assessment will treat “Best Buy Today” as requiring:
  - news_certainty ≥ 0.50
  - trust_score ≥ 0.45
  - Prefer event in {Order/contract, IPO/listing, Regulatory(positive)}
- Headwind penalty: Headlines implying policy tightening/macros negatives are down‑weighted for same‑day timing.

## Next checks
- Re‑evaluate Top‑10 once yfinance rate limits cool down, append same‑day outcomes.
- Monitor if rising trust scores correlate with post‑news multi‑day consistency; adjust thresholds if needed.
