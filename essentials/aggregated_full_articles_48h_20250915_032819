Title   : Aavas Financiers stock sees 7% gain amid attractive valuations

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The performance of Aavas in the June quarter was impacted by a change in recognition policy for disbursements and lower asset quality. The lender has started recognising disbursements after the funds are credited to the beneficiary account instead of the earlier policy of identifying them after cheque issuance. Due to this, reported disbursements fell by 5% year-on-year to ₹1,145 crore. In the absence of any change in the policy, they would have increased in double digits.
The new method also restricted the year-on-year growth in the assets under management (AUM) at ₹20,739.7 crore to 16% compared with 22% growth in the year-ago quarter and 17% increase in the previous fiscal year.
The company management expects the method change to affect the disbursement growth for the next two quarters. It has reduced the AUM growth guidance to 18-20% for FY26 from the earlier expectation of 20-25% growth.
The asset quality showed marginal drop due to seasonal factors. The gross nonperforming asset (GNPA) ratio increased by around 20 basis points to 1.2% in the June quarter. It is expected to moderate in the coming quarters given the improving collections. On the positive side, the spread (difference between yield and cost of borrowings) improved by 10 and 20 basis points year-on-year and sequentially in that order to 5.1% due to benign cost of funds.
The lender has been expanding across various parts of the country, which has reduced the share of the three top states including Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh in the AUM to around 65% in FY25 from 80% seven years ago. It had 397 branches across 14 states and union territories as of June 2025; of this, 80% were in the tier three regions.
The company's net interest income rose by 17.8% year-on-year to ₹322.8 crore while net profit grew by 10.4% to ₹139.2 crore.
Given the weakness in the June quarter, analysts have revised target prices downwards while either retaining or upgrading the call on the stock. IDBI Capital has changed the rating to 'buy' from 'hold' while reducing the target price to ₹2,250 from ₹2,340. The stock was traded at ₹1,633.2 on Wednesday on the BSE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the grey market, the IPO is commanding a premium of Rs 8 per share, or around 13% over the issue price of Rs 61. That translates to an estimated listing price of Rs 65, suggesting modest but positive listing expectations compared to the massive oversubscription seen.
IPO details
The issue was entirely a fresh issue of 2.35 crore shares, raising ₹143.35 crore. The price band was set at Rs 56–61 per share.
The IPO received strong demand across categories — retail investors led the show with bids 165 times their quota, followed by NIIs at 88 times and QIBs at 20 times. Even the employee and shareholder reservation categories saw heavy demand at 17.6 times and 47 times, respectively.
Use of proceeds
According to the Red Herring Prospectus, Dev Accelerator will deploy the funds for capital expenditure and fit-outs in new centres, along with related security deposits, repayment and prepayment of borrowings, including redemption of NCDs and general corporate purposes.
Company background
Founded in 2017, DevX has become one of the largest flexible office space providers in India, with 28 centres across 11 cities and over 14,000 seats under management. It counts more than 250 clients, including corporates, MNCs, and SMEs, and has also signed LOIs for its first international centre in Sydney.
For FY25, DevX reported a 62% jump in revenue to ₹178.9 crore and a 303% surge in net profit to ₹1.7 crore. However, valuations remain rich with a post-issue P/E of 315x, raising concerns about sustainability.

The company has carved out a leadership position in Tier-2 markets while maintaining a presence in major metros such as Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Pune. As of May 2025, it operated 28 centres across 11 cities with 14,144 seats and over 8.6 lakh sq. ft. under management.
Its focus is on large corporations, offering fully customized offices with lease terms of 5–9 years and lock-in periods of 3.5–5 years. The company also offers facility management, payroll processing, and IT/ITES services through its subsidiaries. Clients include large MNCs, domestic corporates, and SMEs.
DevX’s aggressive expansion, marquee clients, and anchor backing fuel optimism, but the rich valuations and thin net margins make the post-listing journey worth watching. The listing on September 17 will be an early test of how the market values India’s coworking story.
Revenues rose 47% year-on-year to Rs 1,59 crore in FY25, while consolidated profit after tax stood at Rs 1.8 crore, up from Rs 40 lakh in FY24. The turnaround follows heavy losses in FY23. Despite growth, margins remain thin, with PAT margin at just 1.1%.
