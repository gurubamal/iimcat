Apparel maker, Cantabil Retail India Ltd, which completes 25 years since inception, is eyeing revenues of over ₹1000 crore by FY27, with an aim to garner strong double-digit growth year-on-year backed by store footprint expansion. The company said it is witnessing good sales momentum during the ongoing festival season aided by GST rate cut and positive festival sentiment.
Effective September 22, GST rate on apparel products priced upto ₹2500 has been reduced to 5 per cent from 12 per cent. “Nearly 60 per cent of our revenue comes from the product portfolio in this price range. Our average selling price is to the tune of ₹1100-1200. We have passed on the benefits of the GST cut to consumers. Since September 22, we are seeing very good traction. So, overall Q2 has gone as per our expectations,” said Shivendra Nigam, CFO, Cantabil Retail India.
Consumption boost
“We expect the GST rate cut and income tax benefits among other factors to provide a strong consumption boost. We also expect this to strengthen the consumer shift from the unorganised segment to the organised segment in the apparel segment. We believe GST 2.0 will have a longer term positive impact on the sector,” he added.
The company said that it is eyeing over 20 per cent growth in the ongoing festival season and is witnessing buoyant consumer sentiment over the past days and expects this momentum to continue till Diwali.
The company ended FY25 with revenues of about ₹721 crore. “ We believe we have the potential to reach the ₹1000 crore milestone by FY 27. We are targeting strong double-digit growth of over 20 per cent to achieve this goal,” Nigam added.
As of September 30, the brand operates 632 stores, including franchise-owned stores. “ In the past six months, we have opened about 30 stores. About 30-40 stores are in pipeline. So we are on track to open to open 60-70 stores by the end of FY26,” he added. Nearly 6 per cent of the company’s sales currently comes from e-commerce channel. Nigam added that the brand is looking to steadly grow this share year-on-year and expects online channel’s share to grow to about 10 per cent.
