In this discussion, Vishal Goenka, Co-Founder of IndiaBonds.com, breaks down why these high-quality bonds continue to appeal to investors, how to evaluate their safety, and what factors to consider before adding them to a portfolio.
From credit ratings to interest-rate trends, Goenka decodes the essentials of corporate debt investing and explains why AAA bonds are still a top pick this year. Edited Excerpts -
Q) What are AAA bonds? And, who assigns the rating?
A) “AAA” is the highest credit rating assigned to a bond by SEBI‑regulated credit rating agencies in India. A AAA rating signals a strong capacity to meet financial obligations with the lowest expected credit risk among corporates.
Ratings are assigned—and monitored—by agencies registered with SEBI (e.g., CRAs) after an independent assessment of the issuer’s business profile, financial strength, cash‑flow resilience, capital structure, and covenant protections.
Bajaj Housing Finance has successfully raised Rs 1000 crore by selling bonds to investors. The company secured this funding at a coupon rate of 6.95%. These bonds are non-convertible debentures and will mature in January 2028. This issuance marks the lowest coupon rate for the company's bond sales since July.
Ratings are opinions, not guarantees, and can be downgraded as fundamentals change.
Q) What factors make blue‑chip corporate bonds an attractive addition to investment portfolios in 2025?
A) Blue-chip corporate bonds are issued by financially strong, well-established companies, typically conglomerates or public sector companies with a consistent performance record and solid market reputation.
They are generally considered safer than lower-rated issuers. These bonds attract investors looking for stability, predictable cash flow, and moderate yields that are typically higher than government securities.
In 2025, as interest rates stabilize and inflation remains contained, blue-chip bonds continue to be an appealing choice for diversification, offering a blend of safety, liquidity, and steady returns.
Investors should, however, review the issuer’s fundamentals, bond rating, and maturity alignment before investing to ensure that the instrument fits their financial goals and risk tolerance.
Q) How does the current interest‑rate environment in India influence the appeal of these bonds?
A) With low inflation and the RBI maintaining a data‑driven stance, the market expects a gradual softening in interest rates.
This environment enhances the appeal of AAA bonds as they allow investors to lock in current yields from highly rated issuers. If rates decline further, investors may also benefit from capital gains, making these bonds an effective tool for both income generation and potential capital appreciation.
For those uncertain about the future rate trajectory, shorter‑tenor AAA bonds or laddered portfolios offer a way to manage duration risk while continuing to earn good carry from high‑rated credit papers.
Q) Things to check before investing in AAA bonds?
A) Before investing, it’s crucial to ensure that the bond aligns with one’s investment objectives and time horizon. Investors should carefully read the information memorandum to understand the issuer’s business model, financials, leverage position, security cover, and covenant structure.
They must verify the latest credit rating and keep track of any rating changes, as ratings are dynamic and can shift with the issuer’s performance.
Evaluating liquidity in the secondary market, tax implications, and transaction costs is equally important. Finally, diversification across issuers, sectors, and maturities should be maintained to reduce concentration risk and enhance portfolio stability.
Q) Could you elaborate on the historical default rates for AAA‑rated bonds and what they indicate about stability?
A) AAA-rated bonds represent the highest level of creditworthiness as assessed by SEBI-regulated rating agencies such as CRISIL, ICRA, CARE, and India Ratings. According to a CRISIL’s latest default rates study (June 2025), the average cumulative default rate (CDR) for AAA-rated bonds over one-, two-, and three-year periods stood at 0.00%, reaffirming their exceptional stability.
In the current environment of moderating inflation and steady policy rates. AAA bonds enable investors to lock in predictable income with near-zero default risk while still earning a modest yield premium over government securities.
While no rating completely eliminates risk, the data suggest that defaults in this category are rare, reinforcing their reputation as the most secure segment within corporate debt. Investors must continue to monitor financial statements and covenants periodically, as maintaining quality requires ongoing discipline and awareness.
