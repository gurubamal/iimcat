Ending her multi-day tour of Kalyana Karnataka on a high note, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman inaugurated the fourth Farmers’ Training and Common Facility Centre for Agro Processing (FT-CFC) at Kasapura village, Vijayanagara, Karnataka.
The initiative, funded under the Minister’s MPLAD scheme in convergence with the Centre and NABARD, marks a step toward empowering rural communities through inclusive, technology-driven, and sustainable development, a NABARD statement said.
The Minister previously inaugurated FT-CFC centres in Koppal, Raichur, and Ballari. This sustained effort reflects the government’s long-term vision to create self-reliant rural economies by empowering farmers through modern agro-infrastructure, training, and market linkages. She also flagged off the first consignment of Peanut Chikki and Peanut Butter from the newly inaugurated centre. She interacted with Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) and Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and toured the stalls showcasing locally processed products.
7 centres developed
Sharing her vision for strengthening the agricultural value chain, Sitharaman said, “Continuous efforts are being made to establish agricultural processing units that enable farmers to add value to their produce and earn better incomes. In districts like Bidar, Kalaburagi, Yadgir, Koppal, Raichur, and Vijayanagara, seven such centres have been developed with support from MPLAD funds, the Government of Karnataka, and NABARD. These centres mark a significant step toward local value addition, rural entrepreneurship, and farmer empowerment, reflecting the government’s commitment to inclusive and sustainable rural development. She emphasised that women’s self-help groups and farmer producer organisations are playing a pivotal role in managing these centres reflecting true symbols of grassroots empowerment.”
Highlighting the partnership between NABARD and local administrations, Sitharaman noted that this collaboration ensures technology, training, and credit support reach farmers directly. “These processing centres are not government-run factories, but people-owned enterprises that help farmers process, package, and market their products locally. She urged all stakeholders to work together with sincerity and dedication, adding that even small, united efforts can bring about great change,” she said.
Concluding her address, Sitharaman expressed confidence that these initiatives would transform Kalyana Karnataka into a model of prosperity, self-reliance, and opportunity for every family.
Shaji K. V., Chairman, NABARD, said,“I would like to begin by expressing deep admiration for the Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s visionary leadership and tireless commitment to strengthen India’s rural economy. Under her guidance, MPLAD funds have been innovatively channelised to create value chains that connect farmers directly to markets, transforming them into agri-entrepreneurs. NABARD is privileged to partner in this transformative journey.”
Vijayanagara is rich in agricultural potential, with nearly 70 per cent of its 1.35 million residents engaged in farming. Managed by Gudekote Farmer Producer Company Ltd, the centre is equipped to process 400 tonnes of groundnut and 200 tonnes of tamarind annually. It will produce a range of value-added products, including peanut butter, salted peanuts, chikki, deseeded tamarind, tamarind pulp, and tamarind seeds. Installed processing capacities include 50 kg per hour each for peanut butter and salted peanuts, 45–72.8 kg per hour for chikki, and 30 litres per hour for tamarind pulp. The centre also serves as a training hub for Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), Self-Help Groups (SHGs), and rural youth, with a focus on agro-processing and entrepreneurship.
All products will be tested at the NABL-accredited laboratory of UAS Raichur to ensure quality and safety standards. To ensure sustainable market access, the centre has adopted a multi-channel marketing strategy, partnering with local supermarkets such as Reliance Supermart (Hosapete), VA Hypermart (Koppal), and Focus Mart, while also leveraging digital platforms including ONDC, JioMart, and BigBasket.
