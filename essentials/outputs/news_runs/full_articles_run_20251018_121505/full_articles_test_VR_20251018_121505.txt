With the Indian domestic box office delivering a stellar first half, leading multiplex chain PVR INOX said it is witnessing strong growth momentum aided by higher footfalls and a robust content pipeline.
Ajay Bijli, Managing Director, PVR INOX, told businessline: “The first half of the year saw as many as 22 movies, which did over ₹100 crore of business. I think this puts to rest the debate over whether consumers will watch content on the big screen at cinemas or at home on OTT platforms. It is clear both these formats will co-exist. Another reason this debate has been put to rest is that consumers are not just coming out to cinemas to watch star-led big-ticket movies. They are also coming out to watch Saiyaara, and Mahavatar Narsimha. Quality content is driving demand. So, it only goes to show that the momentum of going out and watching movies on the big screen is back now and this is very encouraging.”
He added that the films across genres, including Hindi, Hollywood and regional languages, have performed well.
“ Q3 has also started very well. So, I think the appetite for people to go out to watch movies is strong. With a robust release calendar ahead, the outlook for the remainder of FY26 remains highly encouraging. The upcoming quarters promise diverse and high-quality content across languages, and is expected to continue driving strong footfalls and revenue momentum,” Bijli added.
PVR INOX posted a consolidated net profit of ₹105.7 crore in Q2FY26 against a net loss of ₹11.8 crore. Consolidated revenue from operations stood ₹1823 crore, up 12.3 per cent. The company said it posted the highest revenue, EBITDA and PAT in the last two years.
The recent reduction of GST from 12 per cent to 5 per cent on tickets priced at ₹100 or below has been passed on entirely to the consumers, it added.
Talking about expansion plans, he added: “ We have already opened 42 screens this year and expect 58-60 screens to open in the second half. So, we will be on track to achieve our annual target of net addition of 100 screens. The company said in line with its capital-light strategy, it has now 132 screens signed under this model, which includes 44 under franchise-owned, company operated model and 88 under asset-light model.
