New Delhi: Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd, Reliance Industries Ltd’s retail arm, on Friday reported a consolidated profit of ₹3,457 crore for the September quarter, up 22% from a year ago.
Revenue from operations grew 19% year-on-year to ₹79,128 crore.
The retailer's Ebitda rose 16.5% year-on-year to ₹6,816 crore, while Ebitda margin fell by 20 basis points to 8.6%. Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and is a measure of core operations.
Reliance Retail operates across categories such as grocery, consumer electronics, fashion and lifestyle, and online commerce.
Isha M. Ambani, executive director, Reliance Retail Ventures, on Friday said the business delivered strong performance during the quarter led by the company's focus on operational excellence, investments in stores and digital platforms and festive buying across consumption baskets.
“GST rate changes will further accelerate consumption growth as consumers get the benefit of lower prices… We consistently innovate, from curating new collections to creating campaigns that connect with today's Indian consumer, and our focus remains on building brands that inspire and resonate across India,” she added.
Grocery and fashion & lifestyle businesses grew 23% and 22% year-on-year, respectively, led by festive buying. Consumer electronics delivered 18% year-on-year growth aided by GST rate reduction and new launches.
RRVL's earnings closely coincide with Dhanteras and Diwali; the quarter also saw GST-linked disruptions that hurt sales in the first half of September. Nonetheless, categories such as air conditioners and televisions, sold under its Reliance Digital retail brand, benefited the company due to a reduction in tax rates.
The company reported a consolidated profit of ₹3,271 crore in the April-June quarter, up 28.3% from a year ago. Revenue from operations grew 11.3% year-on-year to ₹73,720 crore.
Reliance Retail opened 412 new stores during the September quarter, taking its total store count to 19,821, up 4.6% year-on-year.
Despite adding new stores, area under operations shrunk 2% to 77.8 million square feet in the September quarter versus 79.4 million sq. ft. in the year-ago period. In the year-ago period, it added 464 new stores, while in the June quarter it opened 388 new stores.
Last fiscal year, the company's retail business saw a period of subdued performance primarily due to an operational rationalisation done by the company that saw the retailer shutter large format stores across categories such as grocery and fashion to open smaller stores across formats.
However, during the company's June quarter earnings call, the management had said the business is now on the path of growing its store network.
“We believe improvement in retail should act as a catalyst for the stock, especially given the implied low valuation for retail. We expect core retail to grow 12% year-on-year top line with FY25-28E CAGR at 13% (vs 5% year-on-year in FY25). Analysts expected the retail business to grow at 14% year-on-year, partially helped by a favorable base (impacted by strategic recalibration of store network),” said Axis Bank analysts in a 13 October report.
The company's grocery business saw double-digit growth year-on-year in core categories with packaged food grew by 20%, staples grew by 18%, and home and personal care (HPC) grew by 13%. Additionally, the volume of fruits and vegetables was up by 62% year-on-year.
The company’s consumer electronics business growth was driven by the festive build-up, though demand was impacted between the announcement and implementation of lower GST rates on 22nd September 2025, with a strong pickup occurring after that date. Laptops grew by 37%, Mobiles grew by 22%, and appliances grew by 10% on year-on-year basis.
Additionally, RIL has initiated a restructuring to spin off its fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) brands into a new entity, New Reliance Consumer Products Ltd (New RCPL), ahead of its much-anticipated IPO of its retail business. As part of the restructuring, RCPL will operate as a direct subsidiary of RIL. It was earlier a step-down subsidiary through Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd.
The RCPL demerger is a process in progress, and is awaiting a final order from the National Company Law Tribunal, it said on Friday.
In the September quarter, the company's fast-moving consumer goods business reported gross revenue of ₹5,400 crore.
Its cola brand Campa sustained double-digit market share in key markets for Campa, with positive growth momentum across categories led by Campa and Independence.
At the company's 48th annual general meeting in August, management set a revenue target of ₹1 trillion for its packaged consumer products business, RCPL, in five years.

Reliance Industries-owned Reliance Retail Ventures registered a 21.8 per cent increase in profit after tax at ₹3,457 crore in the quarter that ended September 30, compared to ₹2,836 crore registered in the same period last year.

The company stated that the grocery, fashion and lifestyle businesses grew 23 per cent and 22 per cent year-on-year, respectively. Consumer electronics delivered 18 per cent year-on-year growth, aided by GST rate reduction and new launches.
new stores
During the quarter, Reliance Retail opened 412 new stores, with the company’s total store count to 19,821 stores. The company stated it expanded its customer base to 358 million.
“Reliance Retail delivered a strong performance during the quarter, led by our relentless focus on operational excellence, investments in stores and digital platforms and festive buying across consumption baskets. GST rate changes will further accelerate consumption growth as consumers get the benefit of lower prices. Our success is a testament to our deep understanding of the consumer. We consistently innovate, from curating new collections to creating campaigns that connect with today’s Indian consumer, and our focus remains on building brands that inspire and resonate across India,” said Isha M Ambani, Executive Director, Reliance Retail Ventures Limited.
Consumer electronics
The consumer electronics segment growth was driven by the festival build-up, though the company acknowledged that the demand was impacted between the announcement and implementation of lower GST rates, with a strong pick up occurring after the implementation of GST. On a year-on-year basis, laptops grew by 37 per cent, mobiles grew by 22 per cent and appliances grew by 10 per cent
JioMart saw a 120 per cent quarter-on-quarter growth rate with 5.8 million new customers. The Quick Hyper local commerce offering extended its operations across 5,000 pin codes and was serviced by over 3,000 stores in more than 1,000 cities.
“The fashion and lifestyle business delivered strong growth with the onset of the festival season. Emerging formats, such as Yousta and Azorte, registered a growth of 66 per cent y-o-y, and Yousta reached the significant milestone of 100 stores. The business tapped into regional festivals, such as Pujo in Navratri, through strong promotions, which resulted in eastern markets delivering their best-ever sales. There was a pick-up in ethnic wear categories during the early festive period, and smart casuals and semi-formals also performed well, strengthening the own brands’ play. A strategic shift occurred from seasonal fashion to fresh fashion every day, creating newness in the range with the introduction of over 300 new options per week. AJIO represented a 35 per cent year-on-year increase, and launched several new brands on its platform,” the company informed the stock exchanges.
