Title   : Tech Mahindra Q2 Preview: PAT may jump up to 20% QoQ, 4% revenue uptick seen on steady BFSI and retail. 5 things to track

URL     : https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/tech-mahindra-q2-preview-pat-may-jump-up-to-20-qoq-4-revenue-uptick-seen-on-steady-bfsi-and-retail-5-things-to-track/articleshow/124548631.cms
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meanwhile, the revenue from operations could grow between 2.3% to 3.7% on a quarter-on-quarter basis while rising 2.6%-4% on a YoY basis. The topline range is seen at Rs 13,661 crore to Rs 13,846 crore.
The estimates of Nomura, Nuvama Institutional Equities, Axis Securities and HDFC Securities are taken into account.
The highest PAT estimate is given by Nomura while HDFC Securities remains most modest in the pack even as it estimates a YoY decline in Tech Mahindra’s net profit. Meanwhile, the Japanese brokerage remains most conservative in its revenue estimates while Axis is most bullish.
Tech Mahindra will announce its July-September quarter earnings on Tuesday after market hours. Here’s what brokerages expect from the company:
5 key things to watch out:
1. PAT
Brokerages foresee a solid recovery in profitability sequentially, led by margin expansion and higher deal conversions.
– Nomura expects net profit at Rs 1,363 crore, up 9% YoY and 19.5% QoQ
– Nuvama estimates PAT at Rs 1,338 crore, rising 7.1% YoY and 17.3% QoQ, supported by improved operational performance.
– Axis Securities projects profit at Rs 1,279 crore, an increase of 1.7% YoY and 13.4% QoQ
– HDFC Securities, however, pegs PAT lower at Rs 1,270 crore, down 5.5% YoY but still up 11.4% QoQ.
Overall, consensus points to double-digit sequential growth in the bottom line after several muted quarters.
2. Revenue
Revenue growth is expected to remain modest as the company navigates a still-challenging demand environment.
– Nomura forecasts revenue at Rs 13,661 crore, up 2.3% QoQ and 2.6% YoY, led by both the communications and enterprise verticals.
– Nuvama expects revenue to rise 3.2% QoQ and 3.5% YoY to Rs 13,773 crore, while Axis Securities estimates Rs 13,846 crore, indicating 3.7% sequential growth.
– Axis Securities pegs Q2 topline at Rs 13,846 crore up 4% YoY and up 3.7% QoQ
– HDFC Securities projects a similar trajectory at Rs 13,740 crore, reflecting a 3.2% YoY growth and 2.9% QoQ rise.
The ramp-up of large deals in BFSI, retail, and communications is seen driving this steady top-line performance.
3. EBIT
Brokerages expect a strong improvement in Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT), supported by higher utilisation and productivity gains.
Nuvama pegs EBIT at Rs 1,623 crore, up 9.9% QoQ and 26.7% YoY, the most optimistic among peers.
Axis Securities expects EBIT at Rs 1,604 crore, an 8.6% QoQ and 25.3% YoY increase.
HDFC Securities projects EBIT at Rs 1,574 crore, up 22.9% YoY and 6.5% QoQ, while Nomura expects margins to expand by 40 bps sequentially.
This rebound reflects ongoing restructuring efforts and a focus on operational efficiency.
4. Margins
A broad-based recovery in margins is expected as cost controls and restructuring benefits start to reflect in Q2.
Nuvama forecasts the highest EBIT margin at 11.8%, up 70 bps QoQ and 220 bps YoY.
Axis Securities and HDFC Securities see margins at 11.6–11.5%, rising between 40–50 bps QoQ.
Nomura expects margins to improve 40 bps QoQ to 11.5%.
Most brokerages expect Tech Mahindra to maintain its FY27 EBIT margin guidance of 15%, underpinned by structural cost savings.
5. Key monitorables
Analysts will closely track management commentary on the demand trends in the BFSI and telecom verticals.
Large deal wins and visibility in the deal pipeline will be a thing closely watched by Japanese brokerage Nomura, which expects net new deal wins of $600–800 million.
Progress on cost optimisation initiatives and FY27 margin roadmap and client spending patterns amid global macro uncertainty and outlook for the enterprise business will be another top monitorable for the markets.

Title   : KEC order wins, Tata Motors demerger, and HCL Tech’s AI momentum key to watch: Pankaj Pandey

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEC International order inflows signal sector strength
Engineering major KEC International has bagged fresh orders worth nearly Rs 14,000 crore so far this financial year — about 50% of its annual guidance of Rs 28,000–30,000 crore. Pandey said this performance reflects continued momentum in the transmission and distribution (T&D) segment, which remains one of the most promising themes within the infrastructure space.“We like the entire T&D segment — both KEC International and Kalpataru Power look strong. The execution momentum is picking up, and we expect margin expansion over the next one to two years,” Pandey said.
He added that while the power generation story often takes the spotlight, power transmission and distribution will likely emerge as a key growth driver due to strong execution visibility and government capex push.
HCL Technologies shows improvement, but valuations cap upside
Commenting on the latest HCL Technologies earnings, Pandey said the numbers were broadly encouraging with signs of improvement across verticals. The company’s AI monetization, though still small at about 3% of revenue, is a step in the right direction.However, he noted that valuations are rich, limiting near-term upside.
“HCL Tech’s valuations are now similar to Infosys and TCS, which means it needs stronger earnings growth to justify further re-rating,” he said.
“TCS is already commanding a premium due to its pivot toward data centres, while HCL’s numbers need to improve more meaningfully.”
Pandey cautioned that while valuation multiples for Indian IT are near the lower end of their four-year range, the overall macro environment remains challenging, particularly given rising protectionist policies in global markets and subdued discretionary tech spending.
“Until the global AI boom cools off, we don’t expect Indian IT stocks to deliver strong price performance,” he said.
Tata Motors demerger could unlock value for investors
On Tata Motors, which officially demerged its Passenger Vehicle (PV) and Commercial Vehicle (CV) businesses this week, Pandey said the vertical split is likely to create significant value for shareholders.“We are expecting Rs 300 per share for the CV business, based on 11x FY27 EV/EBITDA multiples, in line with peers,” he said.
“The PV business could trade between ₹450–500, supported by strong growth visibility and the brand’s leadership in the electric vehicle segment.”
Pandey added that the sum-of-the-parts valuation of the two independent businesses implies overall value creation, making Tata Motors one of the more anticipated demergers in recent years.
“Both PV and CV businesses have different growth trajectories, so the split allows investors to play each theme independently,” he said.
LG Balakrishnan listing to draw investor interest
On the debut of LG Balakrishnan & Bros (LG) in the secondary market, Pandey said the listing is expected to see a positive pop, backed by a strong grey market premium.Brokerages have pegged the fair value between ₹1,750 and ₹1,800, compared to the IPO pricing of ₹1,500, which was seen as reasonable.
“The IPO was attractively priced at 37x trailing 12-month earnings, and this is the first time in a long while that a sector leader is being listed,” Pandey noted.
“The company’s strong market share across categories justifies a valuation premium, though we’ll need to see post-listing performance before assigning a definitive multiple.”
Stock-specific action to dominate ahead
Pandey expects stock-specific opportunities to dominate in the near term, with sectors like infrastructure, select auto, and utilities likely to outperform.He maintained that earnings recovery in IT, while encouraging, will take a few more quarters to translate into sustained market performance.
“While the broader market remains range-bound, focused plays in power T&D, order-heavy EPC companies, and value-unlocking stories like Tata Motors are worth tracking,” he said.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KFin Technologies has completed the acquisition of a 51 per cent controlling stake in Singapore-based Ascent Fund Services for $34.68 million, marking its entry into the global fund administration industry. The deal, announced today, positions KFintech as the sole promoter of Ascent, one of the fastest-growing fund administrators globally.
Ascent reported revenues of $17.5 million for the fiscal year ending July 2025, with assets under administration of $26 billion across 18 geographies, serving over 640 alternative investment funds. The acquisition increases KFintech’s global fund administration assets to approximately $340 billion as of September 2025, while raising the proportion of international business in overall revenue from 5 per cent to over 16 per cent.
The transaction brings over 250 domain experts into the KFintech group, which now operates from more than 230 offices across 15 countries, with over 6,700 employees. The remaining 49 per cent stake will be acquired in three equal tranches after fiscal years 2028, 2029, and 2030, subject to EBITDA milestones.
The investment has been funded entirely through internal accruals without impacting the company’s dividend policy or debt position. KFintech Managing Director Sreekanth Nadella said the combined entity targets international business revenues to exceed 25 per cent of the overall book in the near term. The integrated model will leverage India and Malaysia as centres of excellence for technology transformation and operational efficiency.
The shares of Kfin Technologies Ltd were trading at ₹1,115.60 down by ₹28.20 or 2.47 per cent on the NSE today at 12.45 pm.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tech Mahindra’s net profit rose 4.7 per cent sequentially at ₹1,194 crore in the September-ending quarter with revenue increasing 4.8 per cent to ₹13,994 crore, boosted by positive perofrmance in the IT and BPS sectors. EBITDA rose 12 per cent on a quarterly basis to ₹ 2,168 crore.
However, profit declined 4.4 per cent on an annual basis and revenue increased 5 per cent. EBITDA rose 23.8 per cent. Speaking on the quarterly results, Mohit Joshi, CEO and Managing Director, Tech Mahindra, said, “We delivered broad-based growth this quarter, reflecting the strength of our strategy and execution. We launched TechM Orion, our next-generation AI platform, and TechM Orion Marketplace to help enterprise accelerate autonomous transformation. Being recognised by industry analysts, reinforces our leadership in advancing next-generation AI.”
Rohit Anand, Chief Financial Officer, Tech Mahindra, said, “This quarter marks the eighth consecutive period of margin expansion, driven by operational efficiency and disciplined execution. Our deal TCV is up 57 per cent year on year on LTM (last twelve months) basis, supported by strong deal conversions. The board has approved a dividend of ₹15 per share reflecting our continued focus on shareholder value.”
In US dollar, net profit increased 28 per cent annually and revenue was down 0.2 per cent. EBITDA margins went up 254 basis points to 12.1 per cent.

Title   : HCLTech reports fastest Q2 growth in five years, calls AI revenue in a first

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HCLTech reports fastest Q2 growth in five years, calls AI revenue in a first
HCL Technologies Ltd reported a strong second-quarter performance with a 2.8% sequential revenue growth to $3.64 billion, surpassing estimates. The company also marked revenue from AI, contributing $100 million. HCLTech's net profit rose 8% to $486 million.
Defying market uncertainties, HCL Technologies Ltd recorded its strongest second-quarter performance in July-September 2025 in five years. The Noida-headquartered company also became the first of the big five to report revenue from artificial intelligence (AI).
India’s third-largest IT services company reported revenue growth of 2.8% sequentially to $3.64 billion—beating an estimate of $3.54 billion by a Bloomberg poll of 31 analysts. Its net profit also jumped 8% sequentially to $486 million in the quarter.
The company became the first among India’s biggest IT outsourcing companies to report revenue from advanced AI, $100 million in Q2.
Before HCLTech, Accenture was the only large IT outsourcer to call out revenue from AI. The world’s largest IT services company got $2.7 billion in revenue from the new technology, which is roughly a fifth of HCL’s total revenue last fiscal.
Notably, its growth trajectory is at odds with larger peer Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, which last Friday reported subdued second-quarter earnings, even as it made its biggest pivot by committing to invest upwards of $6 billion in data centres over five-seven years.
Much of HCLTech's growth in Q2 came from banks and financial institutions, which made up a fourth of the incremental revenue of $99 million. In terms of geography, much of the company’s incremental revenue came from the Americas, which fetched more than half of its business.
During HCLTech’s post-earnings media interaction on Monday, its top executive said the macro environment was largely unchanged. “Overall demand environment is more or less similar to what we saw in the last quarter," said C Vijayakumar, the company’s chief executive.
“I think discretionary spend in certain pockets is almost becoming mandatory," he said, adding that a lot of non-essential spending was being ploughed into AI.
HCLTech’s AI approach through its products and IP-led platforms is similar to Accenture Plc and in contrast to TCS, which is taking a hardware route through data centres.
TCS also differed in its interpretation of the demand environment. “Lingering uncertainties in the broader economic environment continue to remain a key challenge," the company’s chief executive and managing director, K. Krithivasan, said during the company’s post-earnings press conference on 9 October.
“Companies are keeping a tight control over their discretionary budgets in response to economic and demand volatility," Krithivasan said. “Clients are consolidating vendors to achieve transformation objectives effectively and efficiently." TCS ended the previous quarter with $7.47 billion in revenue, up 0.6% sequentially.
HCLTech’s guidance
HCLTech’s tempered outlook on the demand environment is reflected in its guidance. The company retained its revenue guidance of 3-5% in constant currency terms for the full year. Constant currency does not take currency fluctuations into account.
“We are raising our full-year services revenue guidance to 4-5% in constant currency from the earlier 3-5% in constant currency. Given the softness in the software segment, we are keeping the company-level guidance unchanged at 3-5% in constant currency," said Vijayakumar.
At least one analyst mirrored the company’s caution. “Revenue growth was better than our expectation," said Amit Chandra, vice-president for HDFC Securities. “The lower end of the services revenue guidance increase is good but that does not imply optimism."
Restructuring and layoffs
The management also threw light on the restructuring plan announced last quarter, as part of which facilities that were redundant would be shut off and employees that were not redeployable would be let go of.
“When you're trying to restructure, there will be some reductions, but those are all managed through the regular process that we go through," Ram Sundararajan, the company’s chief people officer, said during the post-earnings call.
However, the company added headcount of 3,489, ending the second quarter with 226,640 employees. This comes on the back of TCS cutting headcount by more than 19,000 in the same period. TCS announced its plans to cut 2% of its headcount, primarily in middle and higher-level roles, on 27 July.
To be sure, HCLTech was the only other large IT services company apart from TCS that called out workforce reduction last quarter, and that too before the latter. During the company’s post-earnings press conference in July, the management attributed workforce reductions to meet the company’s operating margin aspiration of up to 19%.
The company retained its operating margin guidance for the full year at 17-18%, and its profitability jumped 110 basis points to 17.4% in Q2, which the management attributed to the recovery plan outlined last quarter. The margins include a restructuring cost of 55 basis points. One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
No data centre plans
During the post-earnings press conference, the company also dismissed plans of foraying into the data centre business like TCS did.
“From our perspective, we are very focused on two broad elements in AI. One is, of course, building intellectual property," said Vijayakumar, adding that “companies like Open AI and tech OEMs and hyperscalers, they're really investing and enhancing the intelligence layer. Now we see a tremendous opportunity to build IP to make that intelligence layer relevant and scalable for enterprises. This is where we are investing."
He added that the second element included the company’s physical and agentic AI solutions.
His commentary comes after TCS announced its intent to build AI data centres in the country, in a bid to make it the world’s largest AI-led technology services company. The company plans to invest upwards of $6 billion over the next five-seven years to construct and run a data centre with 1GW (gigawatt) capacity. Its management attributed this move to creating additional revenue streams from Gen AI.
HCLTech’s shares ended flat at ₹1,494.7 at the end of market hours on Monday. In contrast, the 30-share BSE Sensex index closed 0.2% lower at 82,327.05 points. The company’s earnings were announced after market hours.

Title   : HCL Tech announces big changes to variable pay policy - Who will benefit? When will employees get hike? Details here

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IT giant HCL Tech has announced its plan to change its quarterly variable pay policy to fixed salaries for all employees and roll out salary increments from October, following last year's process.
“We have also taken a decision to move the quarterly variable pay and convert that into fixed pay and merge it with fixed salary for all our employees,” HCL Tech's Chief People Officer Ram Sundararajan said at a press conference following the release of quarterly earnings on Monday.
HCL Tech's variable pay system has two components. The first applies to most project-related employees. It involves variable pay based on project performance metrics, distributed quarterly. According to Sundararajan, the IT firm has combined this portion with fixed pay, so it is now paid as a fixed monthly salary.
“We had the variable pay, which is linked to project-level performance metrics that are distributed on a quarterly basis. That part is what we have merged with the fixed pay, so that it gets paid as fixed pay monthly,” the HR head said.
Sundararajan said the second component of variable pay is the annual performance bonus, which will continue. If we consider linking your pay to performance, the ongoing component is the annual performance bonus, which will continue to be in place.
The shift from a quarterly variable pay policy will primarily benefit junior staff, while senior employees continue with their annual performance bonuses, according to the IT major.
The IT major will start rolling out the annual increments from October 2025. The company will follow the same process as last year.
"We have gone ahead and made a decision to roll out the increments, which will be effective from October. We'll follow the same process as we did last year in terms of how we go about running the increment process,” said Ram Sundararajan.
The IT major's voluntary employee attrition rate dropped to 12.6% in September 2025, from 12.9% in September 2024 and 12.8% in June 2025. This indicates a decline in the number of employees leaving the company over the past year, based on a trailing twelve-month (LTM) basis, as per the company’s regulatory filing.
HCL Tech had a total of 226,640 employees as of September 30, 2025, compared to 223,151 at the end of June 2025, reflecting a net addition of 3,489 employees during the quarter. On a year-on-year (YoY) basis, the company added 8,019 employees, up from 218,621 in September 2024.
