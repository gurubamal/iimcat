WOL3D inaugurated BRAHMA, India’s largest consumer 3D printing farm, in Mumbai on Friday. The facility houses over 200 3D printers operating round the clock, marking a significant expansion for the company in the additive manufacturing sector.
The facility currently produces approximately 10,000 parts per week and aims to scale up to 50,000 units in the coming months. BRAHMA integrates both FDM (Fused Deposition Modelling) and SLA (Stereolithography) technologies, along with a design studio, rapid prototyping lab, and customer experience zone.
Rahul Chandalia, Co-Founder and CEO of WOL3D, described BRAHMA as a growth engine that will unlock new revenue streams and drive expansion across India and global markets. The facility focuses on mass customisation, rapid prototyping, and on-demand manufacturing.
WOL3D currently operates over 10 experience centers across India and plans to expand the BRAHMA model to other cities and international markets. The company positions itself as one of India’s leading 3D printing technology providers, offering prototyping services, industrial and desktop printers, filaments, and STEM education solutions.
The launch event at the Hakoba Compound facility in Kalachowki included live demonstrations, showcases of WOL3D’s product lines, including the Vinglits toy brand and Divine Collection of 3D printed décor, and networking sessions with media and industry participants.
