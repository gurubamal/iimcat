Hospitality major Hilton has expanded its presence in Chennai with the signing of Hilton Chennai Egmore.
The new 195-room hotel will be developed in partnership with MKR Estate Developers, part of the MGM Healthcare Group.
The hotel, expected to open in January 2029, will be part of a larger mixed-use development that also includes a commercial office complex, the company said in a release. The new hotel will expand the presence of Hilton’s flagship brand, Hilton Hotels & Resorts, in the city, joining Hilton Chennai.
With nearly 17,000 sq. ft. of event space, including two ballrooms, a meeting room and a boardroom, Hilton Chennai Egmore will serve as a premium venue for corporate gatherings, conferences, and social celebrations in the city, the company added in the release.
Hilton had earlier announced plans to double its brand footprint over the next five years. As part of this strategy, they have announced the debut of their first LXR Hotels and Resorts property in India, slated to open in Bengaluru in 2026.
