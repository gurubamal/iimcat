--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UK Business Secretary Peter Kyle is set to push China for greater market access to British businesses, as he attends the first high-level trade discussions between the two countries since 2018.
Kyle, who replaced Jonathan Reynolds in a cabinet reshuffle on Friday, will land in Beijing on Wednesday, according to a statement from the Department for Business and Trade. He’s looking to conclude a trade package which will make it easier for British carmakers to export to China, remove barriers on items such as cattle hides, sheep skins and genetic material for pig breeding, and help UK education firms get their qualifications and services recognized in China.
The resumption of the UK-China Joint Economic and Trade Commission talks after a 7-year hiatus amid rising tensions between the two nations comes as Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer is pushing to boost economic growth in Britain, partly by increasing trade opportunities. The package of market access alterations Kyle is pursuing could be worth more than £1 billion to UK companies, according to his department.
Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson suspended the economic dialog following China’s crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong in 2019. But while the Conservatives tried to distance the UK from China, banning companies such as Huawei from infrastructure contracts over fears of spying and worries about economic security, Starmer is trying to cautiously improve relations. In an emailed statement, DBT said it was pursuing a “pragmatic, careful and confident relationship” with the Asian super-power, which is forecast to contribute 23% of global growth between 2023 and 2050.
The visit was planned before Starmer’s cabinet overhaul, when Kyle was promoted from his previous post as science and innovation secretary. The minister, who is arriving in China straight from a visit to Washington, where he met with senior White House advisers, will need to balance the UK’s relationship with China against its US ties. That’s because President Donald Trump has been clear that he wishes to see western allies distance themselves from Beijing.
“Serious and strategic engagement with the world’s foremost economic players is what will deliver for working people and businesses across the UK,” Kyle said. “More discussions and direct engagement with China will ensure trade between us can flourish, strengthen our national security, and create space to raise concerns constructively where needed.”
According to DBT figures, nearly £2 billion of exports to China were supported by the UK government in the last financial year, including a broadcast deal signed by football’s Premier League with China Mobile-owned streaming platform Migu, a partnership between Oxford University Press and the National Library of China, and a strategic agreement signed by health sciences company Cultech Group to sell products on the Chinese market.
Kyle intends to raise human rights and business competition concerns during his meetings with Chinese peers, according to his department. He will also co-chair the first Industrial Cooperation Dialogue between the two countries since 2022, aiming to promote cooperation on industrial decarbonization and the digital economy.

Company Background
Dev Accelerator is a comprehensive workspace solutions provider catering to a diverse clientele, including corporates, startups, and individual professionals. The company offers a wide range of flexible workspace options—from individual desks to fully customised office setups with exclusive access for clients. It operates through various asset procurement models such as Straight Lease, Revenue Share, Furnished by Landlord, and the OpCo–PropCo structure.
The company has rapidly expanded across both Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities, establishing a footprint in key locations like Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Pune, Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Indore, Jaipur, Udaipur, Rajkot, and Vadodara. Its end-to-end services include workspace design, development, technology integration, and full-scale asset management.
Industry Context
The IPO comes at a time of strong momentum in India’s flexible workspace sector. According to industry data, flexible workspaces accounted for 20% of gross leasing activity in 2024 across India’s top seven office markets. The total inventory in this segment has surged from 18.6 million sq. ft. in 2018 to 74 million sq. ft. in 2024, reflecting an impressive CAGR of 26%—underscoring the sector’s growing relevance in India’s commercial real estate landscape.
Financial Performance and Use of IPO Proceeds
Dev Accelerator has posted steady financial growth, with revenue reaching Rs 159 crore in FY25. Its profit after tax rose sharply to Rs 1.8 crore, marking a notable improvement over the previous fiscal year.
The company plans to use the IPO proceeds for: Capital expenditure towards setting up new centres, Repayment of certain borrowings, and General corporate purposes
Should you bid?
According to a research report by SBI Securities, Dev Accelerator is valued at a Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio of 3.5x and an EV/EBITDA multiple of 6.6x at the upper price band of Rs 61, based on post-issue capitalisation. The company became profitable in FY24 and reported a modest net profit of Rs 1.8 crore in FY25. Lower profitability is attributed primarily to higher interest and depreciation expenses arising from lease liabilities.

Despite the thin margins, revenue growth has been robust, with a CAGR exceeding 50% between FY23 and FY25. The company’s debt-to-equity ratio remains high at 2.4x as of FY25, though this is projected to decline to around 1x post-IPO, aided by planned debt repayments.
Following the issue, promoter shareholding is expected to drop to approximately 37%. SBI Securities has issued a neutral rating on the IPO, opting to monitor the company’s performance post-listing, particularly in comparison with its larger, more established peers.
Anand Rathi Research has recommended a “Subscribe – Long Term” rating on the IPO. "While near-term valuations look stretched, the firm believes DevX’s leadership in Tier-2 markets and expansion into new centres, including its first international project in Sydney, provide a structural growth story."
