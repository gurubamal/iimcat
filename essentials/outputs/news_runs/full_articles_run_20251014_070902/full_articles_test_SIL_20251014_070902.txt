--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Silver prices touched an all-time high near $53 an ounce, as a historic short squeeze in London added momentum to a rally that’s been fueled by surging demand for safe-haven assets.
Spot prices rose as much as 1% to $52.8983 an ounce in London, surpassing a peak set in January 1980 on a now-defunct contract overseen by the Chicago Board of Trade — when the billionaire Hunt brothers attempted to corner the market. Gold also climbed to another record high, building on eight straight weeks of gains.
Concerns about a lack of liquidity in London have sparked a worldwide hunt for silver, with benchmark prices soaring to near-unprecedented levels over New York. That’s prompting some traders to book cargo slots on transatlantic flights for silver bars — an expensive mode of transport typically reserved for gold — to profit off higher prices in London. The premium was at about $1.15 an ounce in early trading on Tuesday — down from a spread of $3 last week.
Silver lease rates — which represent the annualized cost of borrowing metal in the London market — have been persistently high this year, but surged to more than 30% on a one-month basis on Friday. That’s creating eye-watering costs for those looking to roll over short positions. A jump in demand from India in recent weeks has drawn down the supply of available bars to trade in London, following a rush to ship metal to New York earlier this year after worries that the metal could be hit with US tariffs sparked large dislocations between the two trading hubs.
While precious metals were officially exempt from levies in April, traders remain on edge ahead of the conclusion of the US administration’s so-called Section 232 probe into critical minerals — which includes silver, as well as platinum and palladium. The investigation has revived fears the metals could be swept up in new tariffs, exacerbating market tightness.
The silver market “is less liquid and roughly nine times smaller than gold’s, amplifying price moves,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts wrote in a note. “Without a central bank bid to anchor silver prices, even a temporary pullback in investment flows could trigger a disproportionate correction, as it would also unwind the London tightness that drove much of the recent rally.”
The four main precious metals have surged between 56% and 81% this year, in a rally that’s dominated commodity markets. Gold’s advance has been underpinned by central-bank buying, rising holdings in exchange-traded funds, and rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Demand for havens has also been aided by recurrent US-China trade tensions, threats to the Fed’s independence, and a US government shutdown.
“There seems to be no good reason to fight the trends in both gold and silver,” said Shyam Devani, an investor in Singapore. “It has become clearer the trends have accelerated, and are likely to continue because the underlying issues of weak governments, poor budgetary positions, confusion on monetary policies all conspire to push up both gold and silver higher.”
On Monday analysts at Bank of America Corp. hiked their end-of-2026 price target for silver from around $44 an ounce to $65, citing persistent market deficits, elevated fiscal gaps and lower interest rates.
Investors were also weighing the outlook for the Fed’s monetary easing path ahead of the central bank’s next interest-rate decision later this month. Philadelphia’s Fed Bank President Anna Paulson on Monday signaled she favors two more quarter-point cuts this year as policy should look through the impact of tariffs in consumer price increases. Lower borrowing costs then to benefit precious metals, which don’t pay interest.
Spot gold was up 0.7% at $4,140.82 an ounce at 10:04 a.m. in Singapore, after climbing 2.3% on Monday. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was flat, after gaining about 1% last week. Silver was up 0.9%, while platinum and palladium jumped.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tata Mutual Fund has decided to temporarily suspend subscription to the units in Tata Silver ETF Fund of Fund (FoF) with effect from October 14, 2025, due to prevailing market conditions and shortage of physical silver in the domestic market.
However, all existing SIP (systematic investment plan) and STP (systematic trading plan) registered under the Tata Silver ETF FoF (scheme) will remain operational.
Moreover, during this suspension period, redemptions, switch-out, and Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) will continue to be permitted in accordance with the terms outlined in the Scheme Information Document.
Noting that silver is trading at a premium relative to international prices, Tata MF, in an addendum to the Tata Silver ETF FoF, said the premium in domestic silver prices directly impacts the valuation of the scheme.
“In light of the current market scenario, Tata Mutual Fund has decided to temporarily suspend all lump sum investments, switch-in into the scheme & fresh registration of SIP and STP into the scheme from the effective date....The aforesaid suspension is temporary in nature and shall continue only till further notice in this regard,” per the addendum.
The scheme is an open-ended FoF investing in Tata Silver Exchange Traded Fund (Tata Silver ETF). Tata Silver ETF is an open-ended scheme replicating/tracking Domestic Price of Silver.

Title   : Silver's white-hot rally triggers supply crisis as ETFs trade at shocking 10-15% premium

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The white metal, which has delivered a scorching 70%-plus return this year and crossed the $50-an-ounce threshold for the first time ever last week, is now creating chaos in domestic markets as commodity traders acting as market makers report "low to negligible inventory" of London Bullion Market Association (LBMA)-certified silver bars—the only type regulators permit for ETF procurement.
Kotak, SBI, Tata, and UTI Mutual Fund have stopped accepting fresh lump-sum investments in their Silver ETFs as the supply crunch pushes domestic ETF prices far above international benchmarks, raising red flags about potential mark-to-market losses for investors once premiums normalise.
Bank of America has thrown fuel on the fire, raising its silver target to $65 an ounce with an average of $56.25, even as it anticipates an 11% decline in demand next year. The bank cited a continued supply shortfall, with the Silver Institute projecting the metal is on track to record its fifth consecutive year of structural market deficit.
"Silver jumped over 1.5% to above $53/oz on Tuesday, hitting fresh record highs as a historic short squeeze and tightening liquidity in London drove traders to scramble for physical supply globally," said Jigar Trivedi, Senior Research Analyst at Reliance Securities. "Lease rates in London soared more than 30% on Friday, pushing rollover costs for short positions to unsustainable levels."
Riya Singh, Research Analyst for Commodities and Currency at Emkay Global Financial Services, painted a stark picture of the global supply crisis: "Silver has surged sharply as investors rotate out of the dollar into tangible assets, reflecting mounting apprehension over U.S. fiscal stability and the autonomy of the Federal Reserve. Supply constraints have intensified, with robust shipments to the United States amid concerns of potential import tariffs draining London inventories to multi-year lows."
Singh highlighted India's pivotal role in the crisis, noting that the world's largest consumer of silver is seeing prices trade at steep premiums of 10-15% over global benchmarks. "In India, prices are trading at a steep premium driven by robust investment and festival-related demand, prompting physically backed ETFs to halt new subscriptions. Industrial and investment demand continues to outpace supply," she said.
Mirae Asset Mutual Fund issued a stark warning to investors about the dangers of buying at current elevated levels. "Due to the inventory shortage, the premium spiked in the domestic market, and higher demand made it worse. Market makers began quoting at higher levels both on screen (for ETF trading on the exchange) and off screen (for buying by ETF scheme), and investors continued to buy at elevated levels," the fund house said.

The distortion has upended normal market mechanics. While MCX futures typically serve as the primary reference price for physical silver in India, with bullion traders quoting premiums or discounts relative to it for LBMA-certified bars, current supply constraints have shattered this relationship. "The current supply constraints have distorted this relationship, leading to elevated acquisition costs as premiums have gone up multi-fold over regular premiums paid," Mirae Asset noted.
The fund house warned investors to exercise extreme caution: "High premiums will increase the cost of acquiring silver ETFs. If silver prices remain stable and premiums revert to normal levels in the near future, investors may face mark-to-market losses on their ETF holdings or losses corresponding to premium compression. We suggest that investors should avoid buying silver as of now and remain watchful for a few days."
The structural supply crisis runs deep. Singh explained that over the past four years, global silver consumption has exceeded production, eroding the surplus accumulated over the preceding five years. "In 2025, supply remains constrained, as roughly 70% of silver is mined as a by-product of other metals, limiting the pace at which output can respond to higher prices. Demand from renewable energy, electronics, and high-tech sectors further intensifies the structural deficit," she said.
India's import data underscores the severity of the imbalance. In the first eight months of 2025, silver imports plunged 42% to 3,302 tons, while ETF inflows and other investment channels surged. "Consequently, manufacturers are struggling to produce silverware, coins, and bars, while festive purchases ahead of Diwali have pushed premiums higher. Investor reluctance to liquidate existing holdings has tightened scrap availability, further straining the market," Singh added.
U.S. policy developments have added another layer of pressure. Following silver's inclusion in a draft critical minerals list in September, shipments to the United States have accelerated, raising concerns over potential tariffs under Section 232 investigations covering silver, platinum, and palladium. "This uncertainty, combined with historically low London inventories, has amplified price volatility. Benchmark London prices have approached record levels, nearing $53.95 per ounce," Singh said.

The supply squeeze has become so acute that traders are resorting to extraordinary measures. "Some traders transport silver bars via air freight, a method typically reserved for gold, to exploit the London premium. Silver's smaller market size and lower liquidity relative to gold magnify these price movements," Singh noted.
Singh projects silver could maintain its upward trajectory toward 165,000-185,000-194,639 levels domestically, while internationally it could test $56-$58-$59.89, with key support around 153,195-150,000 locally and $51.85-$50 globally. However, she cautioned: "Absent a stabilising central bank bid, even modest reductions in investment inflows could trigger sharp corrections, unwinding the London tightness that has underpinned the recent rally."
Meanwhile, personal finance author and 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' fame Robert Kiyosaki has been bullish on silver, calling it and cryptocurrency Ethereum "hot, hot, hot" in a recent social media post. Kiyosaki predicted that silver could soon hit $75 per ounce, after recently crossing the $50 mark.
Bank of America acknowledged the potential for near-term volatility, noting: "There is scope for recent dislocations to slowly start to normalise, which could then also increase volatility and put pressure on silver quotations near-term."
Trivedi added that markets remained focused on US-China trade dynamics ahead of a potential Trump-Xi meeting in South Korea later this month, while expectations for another Federal Reserve quarter-point rate cut this month, followed by a likely move in December, continued to support precious metals.
