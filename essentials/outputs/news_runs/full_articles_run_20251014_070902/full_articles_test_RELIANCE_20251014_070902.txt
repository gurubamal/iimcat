--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tata Mutual Fund has decided to temporarily suspend subscription to the units in Tata Silver ETF Fund of Fund (FoF) with effect from October 14, 2025, due to prevailing market conditions and shortage of physical silver in the domestic market.
However, all existing SIP (systematic investment plan) and STP (systematic trading plan) registered under the Tata Silver ETF FoF (scheme) will remain operational.
Moreover, during this suspension period, redemptions, switch-out, and Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) will continue to be permitted in accordance with the terms outlined in the Scheme Information Document.
Noting that silver is trading at a premium relative to international prices, Tata MF, in an addendum to the Tata Silver ETF FoF, said the premium in domestic silver prices directly impacts the valuation of the scheme.
“In light of the current market scenario, Tata Mutual Fund has decided to temporarily suspend all lump sum investments, switch-in into the scheme & fresh registration of SIP and STP into the scheme from the effective date....The aforesaid suspension is temporary in nature and shall continue only till further notice in this regard,” per the addendum.
The scheme is an open-ended FoF investing in Tata Silver Exchange Traded Fund (Tata Silver ETF). Tata Silver ETF is an open-ended scheme replicating/tracking Domestic Price of Silver.

Title   : JPMorgan to Plow $1.5 Trillion Into US Security Industries

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JPMorgan Chase & Co. vowed to funnel $1.5 trillion into industries that bolster US economic security and resiliency over the next 10 years — an initiative that will invest billions of dollars in companies and hire bankers and other professionals.
The campaign will ramp up the amount of capital, resources and personnel that the largest US lender already dedicates to a variety of sectors, such as rare earth minerals, pharmaceutical precursors and robotics, or ventures developing defense, aerospace and energy technologies, such as drones, battery storage or grid resiliency.
JPMorgan estimated the effort will add as much as $500 billion to what it would’ve provided anyway.
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon is launching the initiative amid trade brinkmanship between Washington and Beijing. Last week, President Donald Trump vowed to impose a 100% tariff on goods from China after it announced stricter export controls of items that use even traces of certain rare earths, as well as equipment and technology for processing them.
“It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing – all of which are essential for our national security,” Dimon said in a statement Monday announcing the bank’s target. “We need to act now.”
Dimon, 69, has become more outspoken about US security in recent years. The country relies too much on potential adversaries for critical military products, he wrote in a letter to shareholders in May, citing China specifically. In 2023, he wrote that US supply chains for critical products and materials “must be domestic or only open to completely friendly allies or partners.”
Beyond loans and direct investments, there are a variety of ways big investment banks can provide funding to industries without opening their own wallets. That can include handling stock or bond sales, or arranging third-party financing. JPMorgan said the $1.5 trillion target will include funding that the firm facilitates. It noted the initiative will involve its asset and wealth management arm, which oversees client investments.
“This is not philanthropy. This is 100% commercial,” Dimon said Monday on a conference call to discuss the announcement. “We are going to take our resources of research, bankers and investors and we are going to scour the United States and maybe the world for new opportunities.”
Last year, companywide, JPMorgan extended credit and raised capital totaling $2.8 trillion.
Amid the new initiative, the bank will make equity and venture capital investments of as much as $10 billion to help certain companies expand, innovate or accelerate strategic manufacturing. The firm said it will also advocate policies supporting those efforts.
Dimon said Monday that JPMorgan will hire an investment team as well as dedicated bankers “who can deal not with just the best companies in the world but governments.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
India's Russian oil imports between April and September fell 8.4% on year due to narrower discounts and tighter supplies, with refiners seeking more oil from the Middle East and the United States, according to trade sources and shipping data.
India is also under pressure from Washington, which has doubled tariffs on Indian goods, to reduce Russian oil imports. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro had said India's purchases of Russian crude were funding Moscow's war in Ukraine.
A refiner in India shipped in 1.75 million barrels per day of Russian oil in the first half of this fiscal year that began on April 1, shipping data obtained from trade sources show.
September's volume was flat versus August at 1.6 million bpd, down 14.2% from the same month a year ago, the data showed.
Reliance Industries Ltd and Nayara Energy boosted imports in September while state refiners' purchases fell.
U.S. trade negotiators have said curbing purchases of Russian oil is crucial to reducing India's tariff rate and sealing a trade deal.
Meanwhile, India's U.S. crude imports in April-September rose 6.8% on year to about 213,000 bpd.
India's higher purchase of US energy products is linked to the outcome of trade negotiations between the two countries, a government source said last week.
US.trade secretary Scott Bessent had said India would rebalance its crude purchases by buying more U.S. oil and less Russian oil.
Overall, India shipped in about 4.88 million bpd of oil in September, down by 1% from August, but up about 3.5% from the same month a year ago, the data showed.
During the April-September period, Russia's share in India's overall imports declined to about 36% from 40%, while that of the U.S. rose marginally.
The share of Middle Eastern oil in six months to September 2025 in overall imports rose to 45% from 42%, lifting the share of the OPEC nations to 49% from 45%, the data showed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With double digit growth in receipts from non-corporate tax assessees and de-growth of refunds, net direct tax collection grew 6.33 per cent so far this fiscal to over ₹11.89 lakh crore, Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) reported on Monday.
This is the second successive month of growth in collection after three months of decline.
Non-corporate taxpayers include individuals, Hindu Undivided Family (HUF), firms, association of persons, body of individuals, local authorities and artificial juridical person.
For the current fiscal year, the budget estimates direct tax collection at ₹25.20 lakh crore, a projected growth of 12.35 per cent compared to the revised estimates of ₹22.37 lakh crore for FY25.
Corp tax mop-up
Between April 1 and October 12, net corporate tax collection stood at about ₹5.02 lakh crore, up from ₹4.92 lakh crore in the same period of FY25. Non-corporate tax mop-up so far this fiscal stood at about ₹6.56 lakh crore, up from over ₹5.94 lakh crore in the same period last year. Securities transaction tax (STT) collection stood at ₹30,878 crore, a tad up from ₹30,630 crore in the year-ago period.
Gross direct tax collection, before adjusting refunds, stood at over ₹13.92 lakh crore till October 12 this fiscal, a 2.36 per cent growth over the year-ago period. Refund issuances dropped 16 per cent to ₹2.03 lakh crore between April 1 and October 12. According to Rohinton Sidhwa, Partner, Deloitte India, refunds appear to have dipped based on better algorithms imposed at the time of processing of returns. This raises an interesting point as to what are the changes and what impact it’s going to have on taxpayers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reliance Power shares declined 0.93 per cent to ₹45.79 on Tuesday morning, down from the previous close of ₹46.22, following the arrest of its Chief Financial Officer and Executive Director Ashok Kumar Pal by the Enforcement Directorate.
Pal was arrested on October 10, 2025, under Section 19 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in connection with an alleged fake bank guarantee case. The ED had registered an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR/STF/14/2025) on June 16, 2025, based on an FIR filed by the Economic Offences Wing of Delhi Police on November 11, 2024.
In his resignation letter dated October 13, 2025, Pal stepped down from his positions effective October 11, 2025, citing the ongoing investigation. While maintaining his innocence, he stated he was tendering his resignation “considering my arrest and pending investigation in the interim till my name is cleared.”
The case involves an alleged fake endorsement of a bank guarantee against Earnest Money Deposit issued by a foreign bank, which was arranged by a third party. Reliance Power had filed the original complaint on October 16, 2024, asserting that the company and its subsidiaries “acted bonafidely and are a victim of fraud, forgery and cheating conspiracy.”
The company clarified that former chairman Anil D. Ambani has not been on the board for over 3.5 years and is not connected to this matter. The stock has traded between ₹31.27 and ₹76.49 over the past 52 weeks.
