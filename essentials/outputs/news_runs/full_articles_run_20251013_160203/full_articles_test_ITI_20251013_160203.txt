Highlighting that India’s export earnings from fish and fishery products doubled to ₹60,523 crore in 2023-24 from ₹30,213 crore in 2013-14, a report by NITI Aayog on deep sea fishing has suggested focussed approach and an investment of about ₹9,000 crore over next 15 years to make the sector shine like inland fishery.
The report titled “India’s Blue Economy: Strategy for Harnessing Deep-Sea and Offshore Fisheries” has suggested steps in three phases over the next 15 years. The government should lay the foundation work for fostering early growth in phase one (2025-28), scale up activities to raise production and global competitiveness in phase two (2029-32) and make India a global leader in deep sea fishery in phase three (2033-41).
Asking the government to create clear Rules for responsible fishing in deep waters (beyond 200 nautical miles in international water) and a regulatory law aligned with international laws (UNCLOS), standards and guidelines, the NITI report said there is need for streamline licensing, registration and access policies based on resource potential, stakeholder inclusion and sustainability principles.
It has suggested revision of subsidy and incentive schemes to tap the potential of deep-sea and offshore fishing, and also legal mandates for institutions for effective monitoring, control, surveillance and enforcement. “Create a dedicated agency/directorate under the Department of Fisheries for holistic governance of deep-sea and offshore fisheries,” it said stressing on augmentation of research, data collection and stock assessment capabilities.
Other recommendations include establishment of a dedicated Deep-Sea Fishing Development Fund through budgetary support under PMMSY and industry contributions, creating a Deep-Sea Fishing Program (DSFP) with an advisory council consisting of all maritime states and other relevant agencies to advise the Programme Director. It also has asked the government to set up a dedicated Programme Management Unit in the Department of Fisheries to design, coordinate, implement and monitor it.
It has noted that choice of technique must be carefully aligned with the target species, vessel capabilities, and regulatory frameworks that promote sustainable fishing practices. To promote fish exports, it suggested establishing framework and addressing critical infrastructure gaps.
It has pointed out that there were only four vessels in 2023, owned by Fishery Survey of India (FSI) for deep sea fishing, whereas Sri Lanka had 1,883 and Iran had 1,216 vessels and due to which there has been limited participation by India in high-sea fisheries.
India has an extensive maritime area, with a coastline stretching over 11,098 km across nine coastal states and four union territories. The deep waters beyond the continental shelf, extending beyond the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) boundary of 200 nautical miles, contain select high-value fish stocks, including tuna, billfish and shrimp species, an official statement said.
The EEZ potential is estimated at 7.16 million tonnes (mt), including conventional and non-conventional resources.
According to the report, the areas of intervention include: 1) Policy and regulatory overhaul; 2) institutional strengthening and capacity building; 3) Fleet modernisation and infrastructure upgradation; 4) Sustainable Fisheries Management; 5) Resource mobilisation and financing and 6) Stakeholder inclusion and partnerships.
By addressing policy, institutional capacity, infrastructure, sustainable management practices, financing and stakeholder engagement, India can unlock the full potential of its deep-sea and offshore resources while ensuring their long-term viability, it said.

India's textile and apparel exporters are facing severe disruptions following the United States' imposition of a 50 per cent additional tariff, according to a nationwide survey conducted by the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry (CITI). The survey revealed that the US, which accounts for India's 28 per cent of total textile and apparel shipments, has become significantly less accessible due to the steep tariff structure, eroding India's export competitiveness.
Nearly one-third of the respondents reported a turnover decline of more than 50 per cent following the tariff increase. The major contributing factors included requests for price discounts from US buyers (30 per cent), order cancellations or postponements (25 per cent), and a reduction in order volumes (20 per cent). Around 85 per cent of the firms reported inventory build-up due to declining orders, while two-thirds were compelled to offer discounts, mostly around 25 per cent, to retain business in the US market.
Liquidity pressures have intensified sharply, with 82 per cent of respondents citing extended credit cycles, and more than half reporting an increase of three to six months. Around 40 per cent noted that their working capital requirements had risen by over 30 per cent, reflecting severe cash flow challenges across the value chain. More than half of the respondents urged the government to announce a moratorium on repayment of existing loans, while 42 per cent recommended collateral-free loans to ease the financial burden.
About 50 per cent of the surveyed also sought measures to improve raw material competitiveness by removing import barriers such as Quality Control Orders (QCOs), import duties and other restrictions. The survey highlighted a series of policy suggestions, it includes fast-tracking Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with key global markets such as the EU and providing interest subvention and financial relief to the industry to address liquidity constraints.
CITI also asks for introducing a Focus Market Incentive Scheme for US-bound exports and reducing corporate income tax or granting tax holidays to help ease the financial crisis. India currently faces the highest tariff rate among major textile-exporting nations, 50 per cent, compared with 20 per cent for Bangladesh and Vietnam, 19 per cent for Indonesia, Pakistan, and Cambodia, and 15 per cent for Turkiye and the EU.
CITI has called on the government to take urgent measures to safeguard employment, support exporters, and restore competitiveness in the textile and apparel industry. The body said it would continue to engage with policymakers and stakeholders to push for targeted relief.
