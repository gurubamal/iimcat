Apparel maker, Cantabil Retail India Ltd, which completes 25 years since inception, is eyeing revenues of over ₹1000 crore by FY27, with an aim to garner strong double-digit growth year-on-year backed by store footprint expansion. The company said it is witnessing good sales momentum during the ongoing festival season aided by GST rate cut and positive festival sentiment.
Effective September 22, GST rate on apparel products priced upto ₹2500 has been reduced to 5 per cent from 12 per cent. “Nearly 60 per cent of our revenue comes from the product portfolio in this price range. Our average selling price is to the tune of ₹1100-1200. We have passed on the benefits of the GST cut to consumers. Since September 22, we are seeing very good traction. So, overall Q2 has gone as per our expectations,” said Shivendra Nigam, CFO, Cantabil Retail India.
Consumption boost
“We expect the GST rate cut and income tax benefits among other factors to provide a strong consumption boost. We also expect this to strengthen the consumer shift from the unorganised segment to the organised segment in the apparel segment. We believe GST 2.0 will have a longer term positive impact on the sector,” he added.
The company said that it is eyeing over 20 per cent growth in the ongoing festival season and is witnessing buoyant consumer sentiment over the past days and expects this momentum to continue till Diwali.
The company ended FY25 with revenues of about ₹721 crore. “ We believe we have the potential to reach the ₹1000 crore milestone by FY 27. We are targeting strong double-digit growth of over 20 per cent to achieve this goal,” Nigam added.
As of September 30, the brand operates 632 stores, including franchise-owned stores. “ In the past six months, we have opened about 30 stores. About 30-40 stores are in pipeline. So we are on track to open to open 60-70 stores by the end of FY26,” he added. Nearly 6 per cent of the company’s sales currently comes from e-commerce channel. Nigam added that the brand is looking to steadly grow this share year-on-year and expects online channel’s share to grow to about 10 per cent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
India’s retail inflation cooled to 1.54 per cent in September from 2.07 per cent the previous month, marking the lowest reading in eight years since June 2017, mainly due to the statistical effect of a favourable base and driven by lower prices of vegetables.
“The decline in headline inflation and food inflation during the month of September 2025 is mainly attributed to favourable base effect and to decline in inflation of vegetables, oil and fats, fruits, pulses and products, cereal and products, egg, fuel and light, etc,” a statement by the Statistics Ministry said.
Meanwhile, core inflation (headline inflation minus food and fuel inflation) surged to a two-year high of 4.5 per cent in September after remaining stable at around 4.1 per cent over the past seven months.
“Record-high inflation in personal care and effects at 19.4 per cent (driven by gold), alongside housing inflation reaching over a two-year high at 4 per cent in September, were major contributors to the spike in core inflation,” said Paras Jasrai, Associate Director with Inda Ratings & Research.
Rate cut talks
However, experts do not find any merit in the rising chorus for another policy rate cut.
“Overall, the benign inflation and growth trajectory does provide room for 25-50 bps rate cuts. However, the festive-linked surge in retail sales may make it difficult to gauge the underlying sustainable demand in the economy and hence the timing of easing may become more difficult,” Upasna Bhardwaj, Chief Economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank, said.
In a note, HDFC Bank said since inflation is below the RBI’s target, there is space for another 25-50 bps of rate cuts. However, further rate cuts could be delivered only if growth momentum weakens significantly, and tariff risks continue to loom. “In our base case, we expect no further rate cuts from the RBI. However, if downside risk to growth emerges, we could see the policy rate inch towards 5 per cent by FY26,” it said.

Title   : Retail inflation slows to eight-year low of 1.54% in September 2025

Retail inflation slowed to an over 8-year low of 1.54 per cent in September and slipped below Reserve Bank’s comfort zone mainly due to subdued prices of vegetables, fruits and pulses, showed government data released on Monday.
The consumer price index (CPI) based inflation was 2.07 per cent in August and 5.49 per cent in September 2024. The previous low was 1.46 per cent in June 2017.
It is for the second time that retail inflation has slipped below 2 per cent in 2025. The government has mandated the RBI to ensure CPI remains at 4 per cent with a margin of 2 per cent on the either side.
“There is decrease of 53 basis points in headline inflation of September, 2025 in comparison to August 2025. It is the lowest year-on-year inflation after June 2017,” the National Statistics Office (NSO) said.
Year-on-year food inflation during September 2025 was (-) 2.28 per cent compared to (-) 0.64 per cent in August and 9.24 per cent in September last year.
“The decline in headline inflation and food inflation during the month of September 2025 is mainly attributed to favourable base effect and decline in inflation of vegetables, oil and fats, fruits, pulses and products, cereal and products, egg, fuel and light,” NSO said.
According to the NSO data, inflation in rural India was at 1.07 per cent and in urban parts at 2.04 per cent.
Highest inflation was in Kerala at 9.05 per cent and lowest in Uttar Pradesh (-) 0.61 per cent.
In its October bimonthly monetary policy, the Reserve Bank lowered its inflation projection for 2025-26 to 2.6 per cent from 3.1 per cent estimated in August.
Regarding the inflation outlook for second half of the fiscal, RBI said that healthy progress of the south-west monsoon, higher kharif sowing, adequate reservoir levels and comfortable buffer stock of foodgrains should keep food prices benign.
It said that the recently implemented GST rate rationalisation would lead to a reduction in prices of several items in the CPI basket. Overall, the inflation outcome is likely to be softer than what was projected in the August MPC resolution, primarily on account of the GST rate cuts and benign food prices.
Commenting on the data, Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist, ICRA said the CPI inflation eased to a 99-month low in September 2025, pulled down by sharper-than-anticipated disinflation in food and beverages to 1.4 per cent (an 81-month low), despite several other categories recording a sequential uptick in year-on-year inflation prints.
“We expect the CPI inflation to average 2.6 per cent in FY26, dampened by the GST rationalisation as well as the continued benign food prices. ICRA believes that a final 25 bps rate cut is possible in December 2025 with its timing contingent on the degree of further transmission of the cumulative 100 bps rate cuts to the credit market, as well as the growth implications of the GST rejig and tariffs,” Nayar said.
Earlier this month, Reserve Bank of India expectedly left its key interest rates unchanged as it waited for greater clarity on the impact of US tariffs as well as playout of earlier rate cuts and recent tax reductions.
Paras Jasrai, Associate Director at India Ratings and Research said the deflationary trend in food prices has persisted into October 2025 (as of October 12, 2025), with prices of key items such as tomatoes, onions, potatoes, and pulses declining in double digits.
“Looking ahead, a favourable base effect (October 2024: 6.2 per cent) is expected to further ease retail inflation in October 2025. Additionally, the impact of GST rate rationalisation will provide further support. However, much will depend on the full pass-through of the effective GST rates,” he said.
Ind-Ra expects retail inflation in October 2025 to be around 1 per cent, a new low in the 2011-12 series.
“There is a scope of another round of 25bps cuts in repo rate in our view, however much would depend on the incremental data which has baked in the effective GST rates as well,” Jasrai said.
According to NSO, inflation in ‘fuel and light’ during September was at 1.98 per cent, as against 2.32 per cent in the preceding month.
Inflation in ‘transport and communication’ at 1.82 per cent during September too was lower than August.
NSO collects price data from selected 1,181 villages and 1,114 urban markets covering all states and UTs.
