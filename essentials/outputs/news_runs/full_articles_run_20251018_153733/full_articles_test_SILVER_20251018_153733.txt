The ongoing silver rally and a weaker rupee helped Hindustan Zinc Ltd report a 14% year-on-year jump in its profit for the September quarter, offsetting a sharp dip in metal production.
The company, which makes zinc, lead and silver, reported a consolidated profit of ₹2,649 crore for the quarter. Revenue for the quarter was up 4% to ₹8,549 crore, its highest ever for the July-September period.
Silver production during the quarter was down by a fifth compared to last year to 147 tonnes, limiting the company’s ability to benefit from the ongoing boom in silver prices. Lead production too dropped by 29% to 45,000 tonnes, while zinc production inched up by 2% to 202,000 tonnes.
Moreover, the company has cut its silver sale forecast for the year to 680 tonnes from 700-710 tonnes earlier. Silver is recovered as a byproduct of zinc and lead production.
"Looking ahead, we have revised our FY2026 refined metal guidance to 1,075 kilotonnes plus/minus 10,000 tonnes per annum and silver guidance to 680 tonnes plus/minus 10 tonnes per annum, considering lower plant availability and lower silver input during the first half of the year," said Arun Misra, chief executive officer (CEO) of Hindustan Zinc, in a post-earnings interaction with analysts.
Given that silver production in the first half was relatively slow, achieving the 680-tonne annual guidance will require a stronger second half, said Mishra. “To meet this target, we have redirected resources from other mines to the SK Mine and introduced incentives for contractors and workers to focus on extracting high-silver stopes,” he said, adding that this will help the company maximize output while prices remain strong.
The Sindesar Khurd (SK) Mine, located in Rajasthan, is an underground operation and one of India’s largest sources of silver production.
Prices of silver were, on average, 34% higher year-on-year during the quarter at $39.4 per ounce, even as zinc and lead prices remained relatively flat. The precious metal has now crossed $50 per ounce. Every $1 increase in silver price adds about ₹200 crore in the company’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda), as per an investor presentation.
This reflected in the company’s margins. Ebitda, a measure of operating income, rose nearly 7% to ₹4,209 crore despite the lower production numbers. Ebitda margin also improved 139 basis points to 49.2%.
Silver contributed as much as 40% to the company’s profit during the quarter, chief financial officer Sandeep Modi said. “We are well-positioned to leverage commodity tailwinds while strengthening our sustainable value creation through disciplined cost management, growth projects, value-added offerings, and critical mineral development.”
The rupee's downward slide versus the US dollar also helped the company’s profitability. Every ₹1 fall versus the dollar adds about ₹200 crore to the company’s Ebitda. According to its investor presentation, the rupee was on average ₹3.55 lower to the dollar during the quarter compared to the preceding year.
The company’s profitability was also aided by better cost management, with the cost of producing zinc falling 7% year-on-year to $995 per tonne.
“I am delighted to share that we have delivered the best-ever second quarter mined metal production with a 5-year low zinc cost of production of $994 per tonne, reflecting the continuous operational excellence, technology intervention and dedication of our people,” said CEO Misra.
Shares of Hindustan Zinc closed 1.29% lower on the BSE at ₹500.05 compared to a 0.58% gain in the benchmark Sensex. The earnings were disclosed during market hours.
In August, the company’s board approved an investment of ₹3,823 crore in a tailings reprocessing plant at Rampura Agucha with a feed capacity of 10 million tonnes per annum. Expected to be completed by the last quarter of FY28, this plant will help the company extract valuable minerals that exist in trace quantities in its mining waste after extracting zinc, lead and silver.
Earlier in June, the company disclosed its plans to invest ₹12,000 crore in expanding its metal refining capacity by 250,000 tonnes per annum. Presently, the capacity is about 1.1 million tonnes a year. The company said that it has “locked in” the contractors for this expansion, which is expected to be completed by the second quarter of FY29.
Meanwhile, commissioning of the company’s planned 510,000 tonnes a year fertilizer plant at Chanderiya has been delayed by 12-18 months. It is now expected to be operational by the first quarter of FY27. The plant will use sulphuric acid that is generated by the company as a by-product, helping it improve its margins.

Title   : Gold and Silver see sharp correction after record rally; experts say fall is due to profit booking

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After a bumper rally over the past few weeks, the precious metals market witnessed a sharp correction on Friday, as both Gold and Silver prices tumbled on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX).
The decline came amid a profit-taking wave triggered by specific external market factors that temporarily eased geopolitical and economic anxieties. Gold prices of 24 kt on MCX, which had recently touched a record high of ₹1,32,294 per 10 grams, fell by around 3 per cent to ₹1,25,957 per 10 grams. Silver saw an even steeper fall, declining by more than 8 per cent, slipping from ₹1,70,415 per kg to ₹1,53,929 per kg.
Market experts described the correction as a healthy and expected development following an extraordinary rally in recent months. Ajay Bagga, Banking and Market Expert, told ANI that Friday's price fall was a "necessary tactical retreat" driven by short-term sentiment shifts and natural profit-taking after a historic rally. He pointed out that one of the key factors behind the sudden pullback was the more conciliatory tone from US President Donald Trump regarding the threatened high tariffs on China, which helped ease global tensions.
"The strategic case for Gold and Silver remains highly compelling, supported by structural factors including global de-dollarization, persistent supply deficits in Silver, central bank accumulation, and an environment of low real interest rates and high geopolitical risk," Bagga added.
He advised investors to view the correction as an opportunity to establish or add to long-term positions.According to Bagga, Silver's outlook remains even stronger than Gold's due to its dual nature as both a precious metal and a critical industrial metal. "Given the recent speculative frenzy and physical market dislocation, traders must be cautious. However, the long-term trend remains firmly upward, supported by industrial growth," he said.
MCX, which stands for Multi Commodity Exchange of India, is India's first listed electronic commodity derivatives exchange where online trading of commodity futures and options takes place.It functions similarly to stock exchanges like the BSE and NSE, but focuses on commodity contracts such as gold, silverEchoing a similar sentiment, Ajay Kedia, Founder and Director of Kedia Commodities, told ANI the sudden fall was on expected lines.
"Just as we witnessed a parabolic rise in the last two months, this correction was overdue. From August till now, we've seen the biggest rally in nine weeks -- a one-sided surge," he explained. Kedia said that apart from profit-booking, the planned talks between the US and China, as well as discussions between the US and Russia regarding peace, also contributed to the pullback.
"All these developments together triggered the fall, and technically, the market was highly overbought, which made a correction necessary," he noted.
However, Kedia emphasized that the fall does not mean the market has taken a complete U-turn. "No one knows when Donald Trump might make a move. As of now, this is the first major drop in eight weeks. The next week will be important," he said. He added that on Dhanteras, people can still buy gold and silver for ceremonial purposes, but for those seeking returns, the market remains uncertain.
"Silver can fall 8 per cent in a single day even though it has doubled in a year, so a correction is still due," Kedia said. Despite the sharp fall, both experts agreed that the broader outlook for precious metals remains strong in the long run, with the current correction being part of a normal market cycle following a sustained rally.
