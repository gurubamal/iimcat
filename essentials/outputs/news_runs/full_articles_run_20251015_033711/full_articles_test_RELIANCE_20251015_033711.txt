India’s mobile phone exports have registered a strong performance during the first half of this financial year (April-September), estimated to be $13.5 billion, marking a growth of over 60 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) as compared with $8.5 billion during the same period last year.
The United States (US), UAE, Austria, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom remained the top destinations for Indian mobile phone exports, said India Cellular & Electronics Association (ICEA) in its latest report.
The US is estimated to be accounting for nearly 70 per cent of total exports during April-September 2025, compared to 37 per cent during the same period last year, the industry body said.
Exports to the US have surged to estimated $9.4 billion in April-September from $3.1 billion in April-September 2024, a remarkable growth of almost 200 per cent, it said adding that this transformation underlines India’s growing role as a trusted source for global smartphone brands serving advanced markets.
Sustained rise
“The sustained rise in exports reflects the strong foundation of India’s mobile phone manufacturing ecosystem. Global value chains are now deeply anchoring here. The surge in exports to the advanced economies demonstrates global trust in India’s capability to deliver quality, scale, and reliability,” Pankaj Mohindroo, Chairman, ICEA, said.
ICEA estimates that mobile phone exports will reach around $35 billion in FY 2025-26, compared to $24.1 billion in FY 2024–25, he said adding that this growth consolidates India’s position among the world’s leading smartphone manufacturing and export destinations.
“India’s mobile phone industry is firing on all cylinders. The next phase of growth will depend on our ability to sustain the scale and competitiveness achieved so far. We must continue expanding this scale to a level that anchors sustainable exports and drives the deepening of the component and sub-assembly ecosystem within the country,” Mohindroo added.
On monthly basis, ICEA said that smartphone exports crossed an estimated $1.8 billion in September, reflecting a y-o-y growth of over 95 per cent compared to September 2024.
August and September are traditionally low-export months for the mobile phone industry due to production adjustments and seasonal shipment cycles. Despite this, exports in September remained exceptionally strong, demonstrating the robust ecosystem that has taken shape within the country, ICEA added.
