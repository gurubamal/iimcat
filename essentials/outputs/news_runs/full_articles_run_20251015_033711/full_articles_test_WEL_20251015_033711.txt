Wells Fargo's profit rose in the third quarter on higher income from interest payments.
The fourth-largest US lender's net income was $5.59 billion, or $1.66 per share, in the three months ended September 30, it said on Tuesday. That compares with $5.11 billion, or $1.42 per share, a year earlier.
US banks have benefited from the Federal Reserve's rate cuts, which have eased deposit costs - the interest paid to customers for holding their savings.
Net interest income — the difference between what the bank earns on loans and pays out on deposits — rose 2 per cent to $11.95 billion in the quarter from a year earlier.
The Fed's September rate cut is expected to boost banks' interest income from the fourth quarter.
The US Federal Reserve lifted Wells Fargo's seven-year, $1.95 trillion asset cap in June, in a major landmark in the lender's post-scandal recovery and freeing it to accelerate CEO Charlie Scharf's efforts to drive growth.
Wells Fargo is shifting to expanding its market share in commercial and corporate investment banking and wealth management.
