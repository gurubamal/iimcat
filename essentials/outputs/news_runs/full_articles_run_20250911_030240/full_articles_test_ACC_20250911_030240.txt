About the company
Dev Accelerator, promoted by Dev Information Technology Ltd, provides workspace solutions ranging from individual desks to fully customised office set-ups. Its offerings include sourcing office spaces, tailoring designs, developing work environments, and delivering technology solutions, ensuring end-to-end asset management. It has established a presence in both Tier-1 and Tier-2 markets, including Delhi NCR, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Pune, Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Indore, Jaipur, Udaipur, Rajkot and Vadodara.
Their primary focus is serving large corporates with managed office solutions, featuring average lease tenures of 5–9 years and lock-in periods of 3.5–5 years. These long-term leases provide stable revenue, strengthen client relationships, and improve operational efficiency.
Utility of funds
The company plans to utilise the issue proceeds for “fit-outs” in the new centres and their security deposits, payment of debt, and general corporate purposes, including strategic initiatives, strengthening marketing capabilities, brand building exercises and payment of lease liabilities. This capital infusion will enable DevX to expand its footprint in major cities, including Mumbai, Gurugram, Noida, Pune, Chennai, GIFT City, Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Rajkot, Surat, Goa, and Jaipur.
Brokerages’ view
Anand Rathi: At the upper end of the price band, the company is valued at 305x FY25 P/E and 3.5x P/S, with a post-issue market capitalisation of ₹550.10 crore. It has broadened its offerings to include HR, IT, and software services through Saasjoy to strengthen client retention and address evolving workplace and technology needs. Additionally, via its associate Scaleax Advisory Private Ltd, it helps GCCs build global teams in India by providing facility and payroll management, as well as recruitment solutions like talent sourcing, AI-based screening, and team augmentation. Considering these factors, the IPO is viewed as fully priced, warranting a “SUBSCRIBE – LONG TERM” recommendation.
Reliance Securities: DevX has carved a niche as a Tier-2 market leader in managed workspaces with strong occupancies and enterprise-focused solutions. Its multi-model approach balances growth and capital efficiency, while revenue and ROCE have improved sharply. Expansion into Tier-1 and an upcoming overseas foray add long-term potential. Owing to such developments, we recommend to Subscribe.
