Interestingly, the company placed bids totaling an eye-popping Rs 748 crore. The company, an NBFC focused on investments in shares and securities, stated in a regulatory filing on October 9 that it is participating as a financial investor in the IPO. The proposed acquisition involves 65.65 lakh equity shares, company disclosure showed.
It’s important to note that this wasn’t the company’s own money at work but pure leveraging, a common practice in financial markets used by both individual and institutional investors. Leveraging involves using borrowed funds or debt to amplify potential returns. Instead of investing only their own capital, investors borrow additional money to acquire more assets—be it stocks, real estate, or derivatives—hoping that the gains will exceed the cost of borrowing.
The Korean appliances giant's shares rocketed 50% above their issue price of Rs 1,140, listing at Rs 1,710 on the NSE and Rs 1,715 on the BSE. The stellar debut also shattered the "Rs 10,000 crore IPO curse," where mega offerings have consistently failed to deliver listing-day pops. The company also bagged at least seven buy ratings within minutes of its spectacular stock market debut.
Emkay Global Financial Services led the charge with the street's most aggressive stance, slapping a Rs 2,050 price target on the stock—implying an eye-popping 80% upside from the IPO price. The brokerage valued LG India at 50 times the September 2027 estimated price-to-earnings ratio, representing a 10% premium to Havells India.
Not just that, the IPO saw massive investor interest and broke all previous subscription records. The offer drew bids worth a staggering Rs 4 lakh crore as investors rushed to grab a piece of the consumer durable giant. The issue was subscribed 54 times, making it one of the most sought-after offerings of the year, NSE data showed.
At about 2 pm, shares of Winro were trading at Rs 244.45, higher 5% from the last close on the NSE. The stock trades on the BSE under the "XT" category, which is a sub-segment of the "T" (Trade-to-Trade) group, which is a surveillance measure for stocks. Stocks under these categories cannot be traded intraday and positions can only be taken on a delivery basis.
