## 🔍 MISSING FROM TOP 10 (But Should Be #1!)

### 🏆 RBL BANK - ₹306.75 (Not in top 50!)

**News:** "Emirates NBD likely to acquire major stake in RBL" (from IDBI news)

**Verification:**
- ✅ **Sentiment:** POSITIVE (acquisition target)

- Near 52-week high shows market already reacting
- Acquisition talks typically yield 15-30% premium

## ⚠️ SPECULATIVE NEWS (LOW CONFIDENCE)

### Low Trust Indicators:
- "Plans to" - Future intention, not confirmed

## 💡 KEY LEARNINGS FOR TRUSTWORTHY ANALYSIS

### System Improvements Needed:

1. **M&A News Parsing:**
   - "Shuns X, chooses Y" → Y is positive, X is negative
   - Identify actual beneficiary, not just first mention
   - RBL vs IDBI case study

2. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - Distinguish "rises" (positive) vs "misses" (negative)
   - Context matters: "profit rises, revenue falls" = mixed
   - Question headlines = speculative

3. **Ticker Attribution:**
   - Company mentioned ≠ company benefiting
   - Secondary mentions may be primary beneficiaries
   - Verify ticker matches news sentiment

4. **Confidence Scoring:**
   - Specific numbers = HIGH confidence
   - "May/could/plans" = LOW confidence
   - Multiple sources = higher confidence
   - Results announcements = most reliable

---

## 📞 ACTION PLAN

### Immediate (Today):
1. ✅ **BUY RBL BANK** at ₹305-310 (highest confidence)
2. ✅ **BUY WIPRO** at ₹252-255 (Q2 results confirmed)
3. ✅ **WATCH CRAFTSMAN** for entry below ₹6,850

### This Week:
4. **Verify WAAREE** ticker and consider entry
5. **Monitor TAC INFOSEC** when circuit opens
6. **AVOID IDBI** (negative M&A news)

### General:
- Always verify ticker matches news sentiment
- Check multiple sources before investing
