1,KEC,KEC,91.2,bearish,IMMEDIATE_EXIT,Severe technical breakdown: Price 8.7% below 20DMA and 10.5% below 50DMA; Extreme RSI oversold at 8.44 indicating panic selling momentum; Price at 20-day low with 11.5% distance from recent high; Bollinger Band breakdown: Z-score -2.74 (deep oversold territory); High volume capitulation: 2.78x average volume confirming distribution,Extreme oversold conditions (RSI 8.44) may signal short-term bounce potential; No fundamental news confirms this is technical/sentiment-driven selloff; High volume selloff could represent capitulation marking near-term bottom,,50.0,1,92,Technical-only assessment (no recent news),"KEC shows severe technical breakdown with price 10.5% below key moving averages, RSI at extreme oversold 8.44, and sitting at 20-day lows. The 2.78x volume spike confirms heavy distribution. However, absence of fundamental news suggests this is sentiment/technical driven. While immediate panic exit isn't warranted, position should be monitored closely with tight stop-loss. Extreme oversold may offer brief bounce, but broken support structure indicates higher risk of further downside.",733.0,733.0,close< 744.99 (swing_low - 1.0*ATR),21.55 (1.5×ATR),20DMA
2,AURIGROW,AURIGROW,75.6,bearish,MONITOR,Price -6.56% below 20DMA with accelerating downtrend; RSI oversold at 33.33 indicating weakening momentum; 10-day momentum severely negative at -8.77%; Price at 20-day low with 2.26x volume spike confirming selling pressure; Bollinger Band z-score of -2.12 shows extreme lower band breakdown,No fundamental deterioration evidence available - technical-only analysis; High volume spike (2.26x) at lows could indicate capitulation/reversal setup; RSI at 33 approaching oversold extreme territory (potential bounce zone),,50.0,1,75,Technical-only assessment (no recent news),"MONITOR with high urgency. Stock shows clear technical deterioration: trading at 20-day low, -6.56% below 20DMA, bearish momentum (-8.77% over 10 days), and RSI oversold at 33.33. Volume spike (2.26x) confirms selling pressure. However, absence of fundamental news and extreme oversold conditions create uncertainty. Set tight stop-loss and watch for either reversal confirmation or further breakdown.",0.5,0.5,close< 0.50 (swing_low - 1.0*ATR),0.04 (1.5×ATR),20DMA
3,SAGILITY,SAGILITY,70.8,bearish,MONITOR,RSI overbought at 72.97 indicates extreme short-term extension vulnerable to reversal; Volume declining 22% below 20-day average during uptrend suggests exhaustion/lack of conviction; Price extended 6.45% above 20DMA and 12.66% above 50DMA - significant mean reversion risk; Bollinger Band position at +1.01 SD (near upper band) indicates statistical overbought condition; Recent trend turning 'down' after strong rally - potential momentum shift at resistance,No fundamental deterioration signals - assessment is purely technical; Price remains above both 20DMA and 50DMA with bullish alignment intact; Weekly and monthly trends still positive suggesting longer-term momentum not broken,,50.0,1,68,Technical-only assessment (no recent news),"MONITOR with tight stop-loss. Stock is severely overbought (RSI 72.97) with declining volume during the rally - classic exhaustion pattern. Price 12.7% above 50DMA and near upper Bollinger Band signals imminent mean reversion. No fundamental issues identified, but technical setup favors taking profits or implementing strict downside protection. Recent trend shift to 'down' confirms momentum fading.",48.68,48.44,close< 41.99 (swing_low - 1.0*ATR),3.49 (1.5×ATR),20DMA
4,DEEPAKNTR,DEEPAKNTR,65.6,bearish,MONITOR,Price below both 20DMA (-1.95%) and 50DMA (-3.36%) indicating weakening trend; RSI at 30.62 showing oversold conditions with downward momentum; Price at 20-day low (0% distance) with declining volume (-27% vs avg); Consecutive down trends across 10D/weekly/monthly timeframes; Bollinger Band position at -1.96 Z-score showing extreme lower band testing,"RSI at 30.62 approaching oversold territory, potential for mean reversion bounce; No fundamental negative catalysts identified in news (no earnings miss, regulatory issues, or management scandals); Declining volume on down move (-27%) suggests lack of conviction in selling, not panic liquidation",,50.0,1,65,Technical-only assessment (no recent news),"Technical deterioration is evident with price below key moving averages, oversold RSI, and multi-timeframe downtrends. However, absence of fundamental catalysts, declining volume on down moves, and extreme oversold conditions suggest this may be temporary weakness rather than structural breakdown. HOLD with tight monitoring; consider partial exit if breaks below ₹1,700 with volume.",1700.0,1699.0,close< 1695.82 (swing_low - 1.0*ATR),37.17 (1.5×ATR),20DMA
5,PETRONET,PETRONET,30.8,neutral,HOLD,Price marginally below 20DMA (-0.50%) showing minor weakness; Below-average volume (65% of 20D avg) indicates low conviction; Recent 10-day momentum negative (-0.91%); Monthly trend bearish while weekly trend bullish - conflicting signals,Price still above 50DMA (+0.28%) - intermediate uptrend intact; RSI at 49.67 in neutral zone - no oversold/overbought extremes; Bollinger Band position moderate (-0.55z) - within normal range,,50.0,1,28,Technical-only assessment (no recent news),"PETRONET shows minor technical weakness (below 20DMA, weak volume, negative 10D momentum) but no critical breakdown signals. Price remains above 50DMA with RSI neutral and Bollinger Bands normal. Absent any fundamental news or catalysts, current positioning represents normal consolidation rather than actionable exit scenario. Capital preservation favors holding with tight monitoring.",268.75,268.75,close< 270.01 (swing_low - 1.0*ATR),7.48 (1.5×ATR),20DMA
