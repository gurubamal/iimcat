1,KEC,KEC,62.0,neutral,MONITOR,"Extreme RSI oversold at 22.75 with price 3.54% below 20-day SMA and 3.92% below 50-day SMA indicates technical breakdown; Severe volume decline: current volume 197,816 is only 46.6% of 20-day average (424,737), showing weak buyer support; Negative 10-day momentum of -3.28% with price at 20-day low (0% distance) and weekly downtrend confirms selling pressure","RSI at 22.75 is deeply oversold territory, historically indicating potential bounce or capitulation bottom near-term; Monthly trend still shows 'up' suggesting longer-term uptrend intact, current weakness may be temporary correction; Price holding above lower Bollinger Band (822.01) at 817.75, though close - not yet complete breakdown","Price at 20-day low with weak volume suggests further downside possible if support at ₹815-820 breaks; Low volume (46.6% of average) on downtrend indicates lack of buying interest, risk of capitulation selling; Both 20-day and 50-day SMAs acting as resistance (₹847.80 and ₹851.12), recovery faces technical overhead; ATR at 1.94% shows moderate volatility - potential for ₹15-20 intraday swings increases stop-loss risk",78.0,1,68.0,Technical-only assessment (no recent news),"KEC shows significant technical weakness with RSI at deeply oversold 22.75, price below key moving averages, and volume declining to 46.6% of average. However, extreme oversold conditions often precede bounces, and monthly uptrend remains intact. MONITOR closely with tight stop-loss at ₹800-805 (1.5-2% below current). Consider partial exit if price breaks ₹810 on volume, or hold for oversold bounce if support holds."
2,DEEPAKNTR,DEEPAKNTR,62.0,neutral,MONITOR,"RSI severely oversold at 25.34 indicating strong downward pressure with potential for further decline; Price below both 20-day SMA (-2.56%) and 50-day SMA (-3.37%) showing confirmed weakness across multiple timeframes; Stock at 20-day low (0% distance) with negative 10-day momentum of -2.36%, confirming downtrend continuation",High volume ratio of 1.67x (67% above average) suggests potential capitulation selling which could precede reversal; RSI at 25.34 is deep oversold territory where technical bounce probability increases; Price near lower Bollinger Band (-1.46 z-score) indicates extreme deviation that often mean-reverts,"Weekly and monthly trends both down indicating multi-timeframe bearish alignment; No fundamental news catalyst to reverse current selling pressure; Breaking below 20-day low increases risk of accelerated decline to 50-day low or lower support levels; ATR at 1.45% of price shows elevated volatility, increasing downside gap risk",75.0,1,58.0,Technical-only assessment (no recent news),"DEEPAKNTR shows multiple technical warning signs with price 2.56% below 20-day SMA, 3.37% below 50-day SMA, and RSI at deeply oversold 25.34. While the severe oversold condition and high volume (67% above average) suggest potential near-term bounce, the multi-timeframe downtrend (daily/weekly/monthly all down) and position at 20-day low warrant close monitoring. Consider trimming position on any bounce or exit if price breaks significantly below current levels."
3,PETRONET,PETRONET,22.0,neutral,HOLD,"Below-average volume at 0.82x (18% lower than 20-day average) suggests weak participation; Weekly trend down conflicts with monthly uptrend, indicating short-term consolidation phase; No fresh catalysts or news in recent window, stock in neutral holding pattern","Price 0.27% above 20-day SMA and 1.35% above 50-day SMA shows intact support structure; RSI neutral at 49.66 (neither overbought nor oversold), no extreme conditions; Positive 10-day momentum +2.05% with price near 20-day high (2.19% below peak)",Weekly downtrend may pressure price if monthly uptrend fails to reassert; Low volume (0.82x) could lead to sharp moves if institutional selling emerges; Lack of news/catalysts means stock vulnerable to sector-wide or market corrections; Narrow Bollinger bandwidth (3.87%) suggests potential volatility expansion ahead,78.0,1,18.0,Technical-only assessment (no recent news),"PETRONET shows no urgent exit signals with price holding above both key moving averages (20-SMA: ₹280.49, 50-SMA: ₹277.51) and neutral RSI at 49.66. Technical structure remains intact despite below-average volume and short-term weekly weakness. Recommend HOLD with stop-loss at ₹275 (lower Bollinger Band), representing 2.2% downside risk."
