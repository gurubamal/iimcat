October 14 marked the record date for the separation of Tata Motors’ passenger and commercial vehicle operations. Shareholders who held shares before October 14 are entitled to one share of Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV) for every share held. TMLCV will list separately on the National Stock Exchange and BSE once regulatory approvals are completed, with shares credited to demat accounts within 30–45 days.
The parent company now includes passenger vehicles, electric vehicles, and Jaguar Land Rover operations. All existing futures and options contracts expiring in October, November, and December were settled on Monday and will resume with revised lot sizes.

Analysts weigh in
Brokerages said the split enables clearer valuation of the company’s distinct businesses. Nomura valued the passenger and commercial units almost equally—Rs 367 for Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles (TMPV) and Rs 365 for TMLCV—while warning of “technical risk for the share price” as the stock trades ex-demerger. The brokerage noted that index weight adjustments could trigger near-term volatility.SBI Securities projected TMPV to trade between Rs 285–384 post-demerger, with potential upside tied to JLR’s volume recovery and profitability. For TMLCV, the brokerage forecast a range of Rs 320–470, noting the planned €3.8 billion acquisition of Iveco Group NV’s commercial vehicle operations.
YES Securities described the separation as a “value unlocking opportunity,” noting that pure-play passenger and commercial vehicle businesses allow investors to target distinct auto cycles. Bonanza Research analyst Khushi Mistry said the demerger “will lead to sharper business focus for both entities.”

Outlook for each unit
TMLCV enters the market as India’s largest commercial vehicle maker, with a 37.1% market share and a 12.2% EBITDA margin in Q1FY26, despite revenue declines. The unit is expected to benefit from a planned €3.8 billion acquisition of Iveco Group NV’s commercial vehicle operations, which is projected to triple combined revenues and expand exposure to electric and alternative fuel powertrains.Also read | TCS, Tata Motors tumble up to 42% from peak, with over Rs 4 lakh crore wiped off Tata stocks in 2025 amid boardroom turmoil
TMPV, which derives 87% of revenue from Jaguar Land Rover, is projected to grow 8–10% in H2FY26, supported by new launches, strong SUV positioning, and rising EV and CNG demand, which constitute 45% of passenger vehicle revenue. Analysts noted that JLR’s phased manufacturing restart after a September cyberattack will influence sentiment, though early reports suggest retail-level impact was limited.

Title   : KEC order wins, Tata Motors demerger, and HCL Tech’s AI momentum key to watch: Pankaj Pandey

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEC International order inflows signal sector strength
Engineering major KEC International has bagged fresh orders worth nearly Rs 14,000 crore so far this financial year — about 50% of its annual guidance of Rs 28,000–30,000 crore. Pandey said this performance reflects continued momentum in the transmission and distribution (T&D) segment, which remains one of the most promising themes within the infrastructure space.“We like the entire T&D segment — both KEC International and Kalpataru Power look strong. The execution momentum is picking up, and we expect margin expansion over the next one to two years,” Pandey said.
He added that while the power generation story often takes the spotlight, power transmission and distribution will likely emerge as a key growth driver due to strong execution visibility and government capex push.
HCL Technologies shows improvement, but valuations cap upside
Commenting on the latest HCL Technologies earnings, Pandey said the numbers were broadly encouraging with signs of improvement across verticals. The company’s AI monetization, though still small at about 3% of revenue, is a step in the right direction.However, he noted that valuations are rich, limiting near-term upside.
“HCL Tech’s valuations are now similar to Infosys and TCS, which means it needs stronger earnings growth to justify further re-rating,” he said.
“TCS is already commanding a premium due to its pivot toward data centres, while HCL’s numbers need to improve more meaningfully.”
Pandey cautioned that while valuation multiples for Indian IT are near the lower end of their four-year range, the overall macro environment remains challenging, particularly given rising protectionist policies in global markets and subdued discretionary tech spending.
“Until the global AI boom cools off, we don’t expect Indian IT stocks to deliver strong price performance,” he said.
Tata Motors demerger could unlock value for investors
On Tata Motors, which officially demerged its Passenger Vehicle (PV) and Commercial Vehicle (CV) businesses this week, Pandey said the vertical split is likely to create significant value for shareholders.“We are expecting Rs 300 per share for the CV business, based on 11x FY27 EV/EBITDA multiples, in line with peers,” he said.
“The PV business could trade between ₹450–500, supported by strong growth visibility and the brand’s leadership in the electric vehicle segment.”
Pandey added that the sum-of-the-parts valuation of the two independent businesses implies overall value creation, making Tata Motors one of the more anticipated demergers in recent years.
“Both PV and CV businesses have different growth trajectories, so the split allows investors to play each theme independently,” he said.
LG Balakrishnan listing to draw investor interest
On the debut of LG Balakrishnan & Bros (LG) in the secondary market, Pandey said the listing is expected to see a positive pop, backed by a strong grey market premium.Brokerages have pegged the fair value between ₹1,750 and ₹1,800, compared to the IPO pricing of ₹1,500, which was seen as reasonable.
“The IPO was attractively priced at 37x trailing 12-month earnings, and this is the first time in a long while that a sector leader is being listed,” Pandey noted.
“The company’s strong market share across categories justifies a valuation premium, though we’ll need to see post-listing performance before assigning a definitive multiple.”
Stock-specific action to dominate ahead
Pandey expects stock-specific opportunities to dominate in the near term, with sectors like infrastructure, select auto, and utilities likely to outperform.He maintained that earnings recovery in IT, while encouraging, will take a few more quarters to translate into sustained market performance.
“While the broader market remains range-bound, focused plays in power T&D, order-heavy EPC companies, and value-unlocking stories like Tata Motors are worth tracking,” he said.

Title   : Tata Motors commences trade after demerger

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tata Motors started trading on Tuesday with its demerged business — the passenger vehicle and commercial vehicle business.
The company’s shares dropped 40 per cent on early Tuesday; a notional decline post its demerger. The demerged entity ended at ₹395.50 at down 0.88 per cent from the discovered price of ₹399. The combined entity on Monday closed at ₹690 on the BSE.
The company will be named Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd which will include passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR). The existing Tata Motors shareholders will receive equal shares in both the new entities (record date: October 14).
The Tata Motors Commercial Vehicle (TMLCV), the demerged business, is expected to be listed in November.
Revenue declines
“TMLCV will enter the market as India’s largest commercial vehicle (CV) manufacturer with a 37.1 per cent market share. In Q1FY26, the CV segment sustained a healthy double-digit EBITDA margin of 12.2 per cent, even as revenue declined, supported by continued operational efficiencies. It will also benefit from the €3.8 billion Iveco acquisition, making it the world’s fourth largest truck manufacturer (above 6 tonnes). The domestic CV industry is expected to grow 3-5 per cent in FY26, supported by infrastructure and e-commerce demand. The TMPV segment will incorporate passenger vehicle (PV) business, electric vehicles (EV), and Jaguar Land Rover operations. The domestic PV segment is expected to grow 8-10 per cent in H2FY26, aided by new launches, strong SUV positioning, and rising EV and CNG demand, which form 45 per cent of its PV segment revenue,” said Khushi Mistry, Research Analyst at Bonanza.

Title   : Nomura values Tata Motors passenger and commercial arms nearly equal, flags near-term volatility post demerger

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The brokerage has maintained a ‘Neutral’ rating, citing improving momentum in the passenger vehicle segment and steady prospects in the commercial business but warned that index weight adjustments could trigger near-term volatility.
The separation of Tata Motors’ passenger vehicle (PV) and commercial vehicle (CV) businesses became effective on 1 October, with 14 October set as the record date for shareholder entitlement. Following the demerger, Nomura pegged its target price at Rs 365 per share for the CV entity and Rs 367 per share for the PV entity, reflecting an almost even valuation of the two listed units.
The PV business, which will include Tata Motors’ domestic passenger vehicle arm, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), stake in Tata Sons, and investments in Tata Steel and Tata Technologies, has seen a revival in demand. “Momentum has picked up after the GST cut as festive and pent-up demand has kicked in,” Nomura said, noting strong bookings for compact and micro SUVs like the Punch and Nexon.
The brokerage added that the recently unveiled Harrier EV has received an “encouraging initial response,” with bookings surpassing early expectations. Management is targeting “double-digit EBITDA margins in the medium term (from 3.9% in 1QFY26), aided by richer mix, improved pricing, and cost efficiencies,” the note said.
JLR operations recovering post cyberattack
Jaguar Land Rover, the group’s UK-based luxury car subsidiary, has started resuming operations across its facilities after a cyber incident in September disrupted production. According to Nomura, demand “has not had any significant impact,” and production is expected to ramp up in the coming weeks.
The brokerage expects JLR’s EBIT margins at 6.2% for FY26 and 7.6% for FY27, broadly in line with management’s 5–7% guidance for FY26. However, it cautioned that “zero FCF… might have some downside risk” as the company restores operations and normalises working capital.

Commercial vehicle arm
For the CV business, which includes the domestic commercial vehicle operations and the upcoming Iveco Group acquisition, Nomura projects a 5% industry growth in FY26, implying a stronger second half of the year. The Rs 365 target incorporates the Iveco deal, valued at EUR 3.8 billion and expected to close in 2026, initially financed through debt and later 40% equity.
“At this stage, we do not assume any significant value creation from this acquisition,” Nomura said, noting Iveco’s weaker performance in 1HCY25 with revenue down 9% year-on-year and EBIT margins of 3.7% versus 6.3% a year ago. The company has guided a 5% revenue CAGR and EBIT margin expansion from 5.4% to 7.5% over 2024–28, driven by operating leverage and improved mix.

Outlook
Nomura reiterated its ‘Neutral’ stance on Tata Motors, saying it would update its estimates once pro-forma financials are available post-results. “The reduced weight in indices could pose technical risk for the share price,” the brokerage said, adding that Tata Motors currently trades at 4.6x EV/EBITDA.Tata Motors shares opened around 40% lower in early trade on Tuesday, at Rs 399, as the stock began trading ex-demerger following the separation of its commercial vehicle arm. The decline was purely notional, reflecting the removal of the CV business from the parent company’s valuation.
While the demerger marks a major structural milestone aimed at sharper business focus and value unlocking, Nomura signalled that investors may need to brace for short-term volatility as the two entities settle into their new valuations and operational rhythm.
