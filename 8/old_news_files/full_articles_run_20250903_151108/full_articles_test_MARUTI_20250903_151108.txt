New Delhi, Sept 3
Maruti Suzuki India (MSIL), the country’s largest passenger vehicle (PV) manufacturer, stated on Wednesday that it will continue to develop small cars for the masses. However, the company is currently focusing on SUVs because they now account for 55 per cent of overall vehicle sales.
“We believe small cars will continue in India, and we will keep introducing them to this market, including new models. This is the foundation of our business. However, since 55 per cent of the market is now SUVs, we cannot ignore this segment. To maintain our leadership position, we must also be number one in the SUV market,” said Hisashi Takeuchi, MSIL’s Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, to reporters on the sidelines of a new product launch.
When asked about bringing “K cars”— which are smaller and attract lower taxes — to India, he said the company could introduce them if there was a new strategic direction. However, he added that they would not be “economical and affordable” due to new emission and safety regulations.
Takeuchi said, “To make K cars very popular in India, we have to carry out serious cost-reduction activities so that they are truly affordable for people.”
Recently, RC Bhargava, MSIL Chairman, said at the company’s annual general meeting that the small car market will revive in the next one-two years. He explained that a large segment of people at the lower end of the market are still two-wheeler owners who want a safer and more convenient mode of transportation.
“I think there is no question that this country cannot just get by with larger, more luxurious vehicles. People in this country want things that are more practical,” he said.
Referring to Japan’s introduction of K cars in the 1950s, Bhargava said, “India needs to consider something similar.” He noted that K cars are relatively small, with a maximum length of 3.4 metres and a maximum width of 1.48 metres. Their engine size is limited to 660cc. Although they have lower safety regulations, they are subject to lower taxes compared to larger cars.
Meanwhile, MSIL launched an all-new SUV, the Victoris, which will be sold through its Arena channel. The company did not announce the price, stating that it would be declared once they have a clearer picture of the new GST rates.

New Delhi
Maruti Suzuki India on Wednesday expanded its product range in the country with the launch of an all-new model 'Victoris' as it looks to enhance its presence in the robustly growing mid-sized SUV segment.
The country's largest carmaker currently sells SUV models like Fronx, Brezza, Jimny and Grand Vitara in the domestic market.
Speaking at the Victoris launch event here, Maruti Suzuki India MD and CEO Hisaschi Takeuchi said India has the largest youth population in the world, who will drive growth and become the company's current and future customers.
"The Indian automobile industry is changing as a new set of customers is entering the market. They are the young generation and represent the new India. So, we thought, why not create a product that raises the bar in the SUV segment," he said.
Takeuchi noted that the contribution of SUVs continues to go up in the company's overall sales.
"Our SUV contribution to total sales has grown nearly threefold, rising from 8.9 per cent in FY 20-21 to nearly 28 per cent in FY 24-25," he added.
The automaker began by establishing a strong foundation in the entry-SUV segment with models like Brezza and Fronx, he said.
These vehicles have won the hearts of customers and also helped the company to secure a leadership position in the entry-SUV segment, he added.
Commenting on the new SUV, Takeuchi said the model comes with multiple powertrain options, including strong hybrid and CNG.
"Victoris is our first car on the road to get Level-2 ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) with automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning, lane departure prevention and many more," he added.
The model would be sold out from the company's Arena sales network and compete with the likes of Hyundai Creta, Kia Seltos and Honda Elevate.
Maruti Suzuki did not reveal the prices of the new model but noted that the company has invested around ₹1,240 crore in the development of the Victoris.
Takeuchi noted that the model will be produced at the company's Kharkhoda plant.
He also noted that the SUV would be exported to around 100 markets globally.
On a query regarding the product impacting the sales of Grand Vitara, Takeuchi noted that the model being sold from the Arena network would cater to a different set of customers.
Grand Vitara is sold through the company's Nexa sales network.
