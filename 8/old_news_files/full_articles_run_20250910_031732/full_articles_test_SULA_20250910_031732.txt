Sula is deepening its bet on wine tourism with the launch of ‘Haven by Sula’, a new 30-room resort opening this month in Nashik, Rajeev Samant, the CEO of Sula Vineyards, said. Tourism already contributes about ₹100 crore to Sula’s ₹600 crore turnover, and is expected to account for nearly one-fifth of revenues by the end of FY26.
“Over the past year, the wine tourism business has been growing faster than our overall business, which was mostly flat. Wine tourism is crucial for the development of wine consumption and appreciation in India, and for any producer to survive and succeed,” Samant shared.
In Q1 FY26, the wine player’s revenue from operations fell 7.9 per cent y-o-y to ₹118.3 crore. However, Sula’s wine tourism reported yet another record quarter with revenue standing at ₹13.7 crore, up 22 per cent y-o-y. Alongside, the wine tourism business has scaled rapidly, growing at a 35 per cent CAGR between FY21 and FY25.
4 tasting rooms
The CEO said Sula will open a new tasting room at its Domaine Sula property near Bengaluru by the end of Q2, complementing the Dindori Tasting Room launched in July 2025. This will take the company’s tally to around four tasting rooms, including its flagship near The Source, and the one at York.
With five wineries in Maharashtra and Karnataka, Sula is distributing over a million cases across India annually, according to its quarterly earnings report. Its Nashik campus today hosts over 330,000 visitors annually.
Sula Vineyards has emerged as India’s largest wine company over the years, commanding over 50 per cent of the domestic wine market. The CEO highlighted that the company will remain focused on increasing its domestic market share.
“Our number one priority is increasing domestic consumption of wine and growing the market in India. Within the country, metro and tier-1 cities are where the action is for wine. Tier-2 markets are evolving slowly and will take more time to grow. These cities will first shift towards premium branded spirits from local, cheaper brands, and then we expect to see a rise in female drinkers,” Samant noted.
Wine consumption in India is currently concentrated in about 15 cities — including Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune— where the company is focusing its efforts.
“For example, Chennai and Kolkata are underdeveloped in terms of wine consumption. Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru, and NCR are a little ahead, while Hyderabad is growing very fast. We have our hands full with these places, and it’s easier to do activations here rather than going out into the Talukas or districts. For the next 3-4 years, our focus will be on metro and tier one cities,” he said.
