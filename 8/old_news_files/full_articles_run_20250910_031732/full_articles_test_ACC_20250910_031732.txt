UK Business Secretary Peter Kyle is set to push China for greater market access to British businesses, as he attends the first high-level trade discussions between the two countries since 2018.
Kyle, who replaced Jonathan Reynolds in a cabinet reshuffle on Friday, will land in Beijing on Wednesday, according to a statement from the Department for Business and Trade. He’s looking to conclude a trade package which will make it easier for British carmakers to export to China, remove barriers on items such as cattle hides, sheep skins and genetic material for pig breeding, and help UK education firms get their qualifications and services recognized in China.
The resumption of the UK-China Joint Economic and Trade Commission talks after a 7-year hiatus amid rising tensions between the two nations comes as Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer is pushing to boost economic growth in Britain, partly by increasing trade opportunities. The package of market access alterations Kyle is pursuing could be worth more than £1 billion to UK companies, according to his department.
Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson suspended the economic dialog following China’s crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong in 2019. But while the Conservatives tried to distance the UK from China, banning companies such as Huawei from infrastructure contracts over fears of spying and worries about economic security, Starmer is trying to cautiously improve relations. In an emailed statement, DBT said it was pursuing a “pragmatic, careful and confident relationship” with the Asian super-power, which is forecast to contribute 23% of global growth between 2023 and 2050.
The visit was planned before Starmer’s cabinet overhaul, when Kyle was promoted from his previous post as science and innovation secretary. The minister, who is arriving in China straight from a visit to Washington, where he met with senior White House advisers, will need to balance the UK’s relationship with China against its US ties. That’s because President Donald Trump has been clear that he wishes to see western allies distance themselves from Beijing.
“Serious and strategic engagement with the world’s foremost economic players is what will deliver for working people and businesses across the UK,” Kyle said. “More discussions and direct engagement with China will ensure trade between us can flourish, strengthen our national security, and create space to raise concerns constructively where needed.”
According to DBT figures, nearly £2 billion of exports to China were supported by the UK government in the last financial year, including a broadcast deal signed by football’s Premier League with China Mobile-owned streaming platform Migu, a partnership between Oxford University Press and the National Library of China, and a strategic agreement signed by health sciences company Cultech Group to sell products on the Chinese market.
Kyle intends to raise human rights and business competition concerns during his meetings with Chinese peers, according to his department. He will also co-chair the first Industrial Cooperation Dialogue between the two countries since 2022, aiming to promote cooperation on industrial decarbonization and the digital economy.

Title   : Dev Accelerator IPO opens for subscription today; GMP at 16%: Should you bid?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Price band and IPO details
The book-built issue is priced in the band of Rs 56–61 per share and comprises a fresh issue of 2.35 crore shares. At the upper price band, Dev Accelerator is valued at 305x FY25 earnings and 3.5x sales, giving it a post-issue market cap of Rs 550 crore. Analysts flag the IPO as expensive compared with peers such as Awfis Space Solutions, which trades at 58x earnings with a higher return profile.
Company overview
Founded in 2017, Dev Accelerator provides managed office solutions, co-working spaces, and design-build services.

The company has carved out a leadership position in Tier-2 markets while maintaining a presence in major metros such as Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Pune. As of May 2025, it operated 28 centres across 11 cities with 14,144 seats and over 8.6 lakh sq. ft. under management.
Its focus is on large corporations, offering fully customized offices with lease terms of 5–9 years and lock-in periods of 3.5–5 years. The company also offers facility management, payroll processing, and IT/ITES services through its subsidiaries. Clients include large MNCs, domestic corporates, and SMEs.
Financials
Revenues rose 47% year-on-year to Rs 1,59 crore in FY25, while consolidated profit after tax stood at Rs 1.8 crore, up from Rs 40 lakh in FY24. The turnaround follows heavy losses in FY23. Despite growth, margins remain thin, with PAT margin at just 1.1%.
Strengths
The company’s long-term contracts provide stable revenue visibility. Its high occupancy levels (87% in FY25) and strong foothold in Tier-2 cities position it well to benefit from the rapid expansion of India’s flexible office market, expected to nearly double over the next five years. Diversification into IT, payroll, and facility management services adds to client stickiness.
Risks
The company remains dependent on a limited set of centres, especially in Gujarat, which contributed over 30% of FY25 revenues. Profitability is still fragile, with heavy depreciation and finance costs eating into earnings. It also relies on leased properties, exposing it to rental cost escalations. High client concentration and competition from larger peers are additional risks.
Should you subscribe?
Anand Rathi Research has recommended a “Subscribe – Long Term” rating on the IPO. "While near-term valuations look stretched, the firm believes DevX’s leadership in Tier-2 markets and expansion into new centres, including its first international project in Sydney, provide a structural growth story."
