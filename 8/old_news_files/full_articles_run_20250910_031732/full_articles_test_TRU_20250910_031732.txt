General Motors Co. is pausing plans to eliminate a shift at its lone pickup-truck assembly plant in Canada, offering a temporary reprieve for hundreds of workers affected by President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
The Detroit-based automaker will keep three shifts at its factory in Oshawa, Ontario, until at least Jan. 30, according to Unifor, which represents workers at the plant that makes the Chevrolet Silverado.
In May, GM said it would cut one shift at the plant “in light of forecasted demand and the evolving trade environment,” and had planned to make the reduction this fall. The company has announced plans to boost Silverado output at a factory in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
The union also said Stellantis NV is bringing back a third shift at its factory in Windsor, Ontario, right across the border from Detroit, in the first quarter of 2026. Production was reduced at that plant, which makes Chrysler minivans and the Dodge Charger Daytona, shortly after Trump imposed tariffs on foreign-made automobiles.
Prime Minister Mark Carney retaliated by placing similar levies on US-made cars and light trucks — but soon after, his government said auto companies would be able to apply for tariff relief as long as they continued producing vehicles and investing in Canada.
Unifor has been pressuring Carney not to sign a trade deal with Trump that would enshrine tariffs on goods made in Canada.
“Auto workers still face a highly precarious situation in Oshawa as well as other auto communities, but it does show that the work our union is doing and the message our members are sending to decision-makers is making a difference,” Unifor National President Lana Payne said in a statement.

Title   : Sensex jumps over 300 pts, Nifty50 tops 24,950 after Trump revives trade talks with India

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The S&P BSE Sensex rose 321 points, or 0.4%, to 81,422.34 at the open, while the NSE Nifty 50 advanced 95.85 points, or 0.39%, to 24,964.45. At 9:43 AM, Sensex traded 471 or 0.58% higher at 81,573, whereas Nifty50 rose 144 pts or 0.58% to 25,012.
On the 30-stock Sensex pack, IT majors HCL Technologies, TCS, Tech Mahindra, L&T and Infosys were among the top performers, rising between 1% and 2%.
On a sectoral basis, gains were led by financials and IT shares, with the sectoral indices up 0.5% and 2%, respectively.
Broader markets also participated in the rally, with both small-cap and mid-cap indices advancing 0.5%.
The Nifty has climbed about 1.2% over the past five sessions but remains 5.4% below its record high set on September 27, 2024.
Investors, however, were reminded of simmering geopolitical risks after Donald Trump pressed European Union officials to impose 100% tariffs on China and India as part of a broader effort to pressure Russia, Reuters reported, citing a U.S. official and an EU diplomat.
At the same time, Trump struck a conciliatory note on bilateral ties, saying the U.S. was looking to expand trade with India amid ongoing talks to lower barriers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he looked forward to speaking with Trump and that both sides were working to wrap up negotiations quickly.
Expert views
Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, said that while “a major positive for the market today comes from President Trump’s initiative to improve India-U.S. relations and PM Modi’s positive response,” investors should be cautious. “From past experience the market should judge President Trump by his actions and not words,” he said.Vijayakumar noted that stretched valuations, particularly in the broader market, remain a hurdle for any meaningful rally, pointing out that India’s performance has lagged global peers, with the Nifty down 0.69% over the past year compared with gains of 51% and 31% in the Hang Seng and Kospi, respectively.
“Massive sustained selling by FIIs triggered by high Indian valuations is the principal reason for this underperformance,” he said, warning that overseas investors who shifted to other markets and profited “might do it again.” A reversal in this trend, he added, would depend on clearer signs of an earnings recovery.
Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Investments, said the Nifty continues to face resistance at the 24,870 mark. “Oscillators continue to point towards more upsides, which was a highlight of the previous day as well,” he noted, adding that the index could stretch higher with “the upside objective … extended to 25,400.”
However, he cautioned that “inability to push beyond the 25,100 region, or a direct fall below 24,700 could delay the maturity of upsides.”
Global Markets
Asian equities advanced on Wednesday, following Wall Street’s march to fresh records, while bond prices slipped as investors grew more confident that softening U.S. labour data would push the Federal Reserve to cut rates next week.Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.3%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.3% and Taiwan’s benchmark climbed 1.46% to an all-time high. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 0.5%, and mainland China’s blue-chip stocks edged up 0.2%.
Overnight in New York, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average all closed at record highs. Futures on the S&P 500 were up another 0.2% in early Asian trading.
Markets are treating a quarter-point rate cut by the Fed next Wednesday as a near certainty, while the CME Group’s FedWatch tool shows traders assigning a 7% chance of a larger half-point move, according to Reuters.
Gold rose 0.2% to $3,633 per ounce, after surging to a record $3,673.95 in the previous session.

Title   : Amid iPhone 17 series launch, how US tariffs and Trump's ‘Make in US’ demand could jack Apple phone prices to  ₹3 lakh

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tech and electronics major Apple Inc. is set to launch its latest iPhone series 17 later today, along with a few accessories such as the AirPods Pro 3 and the Apple Watch Ultra 3.
However, there is another aspect looming. Notably, Apple's production line is largely based in China, and with Trump's tariff offensive, it leaned heavily on its India facilities to pick up demand. But that could change.
United States President Donald Trump is insistent that manufacturers start producing in the US, instead of China or India. For customers, especially, this could mean anything from a 40-50 per cent hike in cost to doubling and tripling of prices!
According to an AP report, both Trump and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have repeated what analysts feel is an “unrealistic demand.” Why? For one, it would take years to pull off, and even if achieved, the cost of a full US-made iPhone “would result in a doubling, or even a tripling, of the iPhone's current average price of about $1,000.”
In terms of pricing, the rumour mill is currently churning numbers closer to previous releases, with the base variant at $799 ( ₹79,900) and price hikes between $50-100 estimated for the Air, Pro, and Pro Max models, up to $1,249 (approximately ₹1,45,000).
But, tech analysts have warned that a “full” US-made iPhone could triple prices to $3,500 (around ₹3.1 lakh), CNN reported. Further, CNBC cited a Bank of America Securities official to note that the cost of labour difference between China and the US is dear — $40 ( ₹3,500) per unit in China vs $200 ( ₹17,219) per unit in the US — which could inflate the final cost of a US-made iPhone.
But, US manufacturing is still a long way away. The tariff impact on cost is still closer. According to a Reuters report, citing Rosenblatt Securities' estimates, if Apple chooses to pass down the tariffs to customers, the prices of all its models could jump by at least 43 per cent.
For the base model, that would be a jump from $799 to $1,142 (approximately ₹1,45,000), while the other models increase up to $2,300 (around ₹2 lakh) from $1,249.
Notably, at the recent launch of its new Pixel smartphone, Google did not increase prices. All eyes will thus be on the launch event today to see what route Apple takes.
