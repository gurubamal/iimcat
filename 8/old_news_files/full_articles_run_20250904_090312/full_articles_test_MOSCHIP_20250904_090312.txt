The sharp rally followed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pitch at the Semicon India 2025 Summit, where he stated that India's semiconductor industry is poised to command a significant share of the $1 trillion global market in the coming years.
Modi emphasized that the country is transforming into a full-stack semiconductor nation, with strong policy support, robust infrastructure development, and a sharp focus on skilling and innovation.
At a high-profile CEO roundtable, Modi met with top global semiconductor leaders including Christophe Fouquet of ASML, Kai Beckmann of Merck, Tim Archer of Lam Research, and Toshiki Kawai of Tokyo Electron.
He highlighted India’s potential as a hub for semiconductor innovation and manufacturing and assured that government policy would continue to be shaped through direct industry feedback.
Modi also confirmed that work is underway on the second phase of the India Semiconductor Mission (ISM 2.0), aimed at accelerating the roadmap with fresh reforms and strategic clarity.
The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology noted that the first phase of ISM has already attracted Rs 1.5 lakh crore in investments across 10 semiconductor projects, currently in various stages of completion.
In parallel, Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw reaffirmed to global investors that India’s proven design capabilities, expanding talent pool, and growing manufacturing base position the country strongly in global chip supply chains.
For Moschip Technologies, a leading Indian fabless semiconductor and embedded systems company, the developments are seen as a major tailwind. With the government’s focus on nurturing homegrown capabilities and design-led growth, the company stands to benefit from both policy incentives and rising demand for domestic semiconductor solutions.
