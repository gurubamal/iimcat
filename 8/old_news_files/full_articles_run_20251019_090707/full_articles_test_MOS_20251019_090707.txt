In a powerful assertion of India’s growing defence capabilities, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday declared that “every inch of Pakistan’s territory is now within the reach of BrahMos”, as he and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath flagged off the first batch of BrahMos missiles manufactured at the UP Defence Industrial Corridor.
Singh also revealed that BrahMos Aerospace has recently signed contracts worth ₹4,000 crore with two countries in the last month, underlining the global demand for Indian-made defence systems.
The Lucknow facility, spread across 200 acres and built at a cost of ₹380 crore, is expected to produce around 100 missile systems annually, generating an estimated turnover of ₹3,000 crore and contributing ₹500 crore in GST from the next financial year.
“Each system not only protects the nation but also bolsters the economy,” Singh said, stating that taxes from one missile’s production could fund schools, hospitals, and public welfare programs.
The event marked a milestone in India’s drive toward self-reliance in defence production, with the BrahMos Integration and Testing Facility Centre in Lucknow delivering its first missiles just five months after its virtual inauguration in May.
Describing the BrahMos as “not just a missile, but a symbol of the growing indigenous capabilities of the nation,” Singh emphasised the missile’s speed, precision, and power, hailing it as “the backbone of our Armed Forces.”
Referring to the recent Operation Sindoor, Singh said that the missile system played a decisive role, adding that, “Operation Sindoor is proof that victory has become our habit. The operation was just a trailer. It has made Pakistan realise what might follow.”
Singh urged further development of homegrown technologies to secure India’s defence supply chains. “Be it advanced seekers or ramjet engines, we must develop all types of technologies indigenously so that our supply chain remains within India,” he said.
Acknowledging challenges with international supply of defence components, Singh underscored the importance of bolstering small and medium industries to avoid foreign dependencies. “If a country refuses to supply a spare part, our system should not halt. That’s why small industries must be empowered and integrated into the defence ecosystem,” he said.
Praising the rapid progress of the UP Defence Industrial Corridor, the Defence Minister said that Lucknow is poised to become a global hub for defence technology and innovation.
Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath echoed this sentiment, calling BrahMos “a missile of Aatmanirbharta” and crediting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Rajnath Singh for enabling Uttar Pradesh to play a key role in national security. He noted that over 15,000 youth have already gained employment across the corridor’s six nodes.
The event also saw the inauguration of the Booster Building and live demonstrations, including booster docking and equipment displays such as the mobile autonomous launcher.
Titanium & Superalloy Materials Plant
He also dedicated to the nation a Titanium and Superalloy Materials Plant at PTC Industries’ Strategic Materials Technology Complex in Lucknow,
In this context, he said, the plant inaugurated, which is one of the first private sector manufacturing units to make aero-engine components and super alloy components etc., will go a long way in helping India produce rare materials.
