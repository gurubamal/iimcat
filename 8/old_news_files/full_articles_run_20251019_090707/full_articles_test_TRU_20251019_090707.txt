--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
US President Donald Trump on Friday signed orders expanding credits for US auto and engine production and setting new 25 per cent tariffs on imported medium- and heavy-duty trucks and parts starting November 1.
The tariffs, which the orders say are being made on national security grounds, are aimed at shifting more auto production to the United States but could be a significant blow to Mexico, which is the largest exporter of medium- and heavy-duty trucks to the United States.
Trump is also setting a 10 per cent tariff on imported buses.
Trump's order makes automakers eligible for a credit equal to 3.75 per cent of the suggested retail price for US assembled vehicles through 2030 to offset import tariffs on parts.
He is also extending the 3.75 per cent credit for US engine production and for US medium- and heavy-duty truck production.
The new tariffs cover all Class 3 through Class 8 trucks, including large pick-up trucks, moving trucks, cargo trucks, dump trucks, and tractors for 18-wheelers.
Trump last month said the tariffs were to protect manufacturers from "unfair outside competition" and the move would benefit companies such as Paccar-owned Peterbilt and Kenworth and Daimler Truck-owned Freightliner.
The US Chamber of Commerce earlier urged Trump not to impose new truck tariffs, noting the top five import sources are Mexico, Canada, Japan, Germany, and Finland "all of which are allies or close partners of the United States posing no threat to US national security."
Reuters first reported the details of the auto tariff action on October 3.
The order provides GM, Ford, Toyota Motor, Stellantis, Honda, Tesla, and other automakers with financial relief against tariffs paid on imported auto parts that were previously imposed by the Trump administration.
The Commerce Department said in June it planned an import adjustment offset equal to 3.75 per cent of the suggested retail price for eligible US assembled vehicles through April 2026 and then a second year at 2.5 per cent to address tariffs from imported automobile parts.
The revised credit expands it to five years, keeps it at 3.75 per cent throughout and extends it to more parts, which makes it more valuable for automakers and could give companies more incentive to shift production, Republican Senator Bernie Moreno said.
Ford CEO Jim Farley said Trump’s order would help make auto parts affordable for US production and the new import tariffs on larger trucks would help level the playing field with imports.
In May, Trump imposed 25 per cent auto tariffs on more than $460 billion worth of imports of vehicles and auto parts annually, but has since struck deals to reduce those tariffs on some countries including Japan, the United Kingdom and the European Union.
The Commerce Department said in August it was hiking steel and aluminum tariffs on more than 400 products including numerous auto parts totaling $240 billion in annual imports. The parts include automotive exhaust systems and steel needed for electric vehicles as well as components for buses.
GM said earlier this year the company will face up to $5 billion in gross tariff-related costs this year, while Ford cited a $3 billion gross hit.

"The market doesn't really know what to take when Donald Trump speaks," said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth. "There's just a lot of back-and-forth comments with regards to China and trade tariffs and pretty much everything else."
Regional bank stocks rebounded following a selloff on Thursday, when Zions Bancorporation disclosed losses tied to two commercial and industrial loans and Western Alliance revealed it had initiated a lawsuit alleging fraud by Cantor Group V, LLC.
"There's a lot more bark than bite on the credit fears," said Jed Ellerbroek, a portfolio manager at Argent Capital. "Looking through all the big banks' results, credit is very good. Overall, there are very few pockets of weakness."
Truist Financial gained 3.7% after the bank reported higher third-quarter profit. Fifth Third Bancorp rose 1.3%, Zions shares rebounded from losses the day before to close 5.8% higher, and Western Alliance advanced 3.1%.
The S&P Composite 1500 Regional Banks index climbed 1.8% after tumbling almost 6% the day before.
The S&P 500 financial sector index, which includes the largest U.S. banks, rose 0.8%.
Robust earnings from JPMorgan and other big banks this week helped get the third-quarter earnings season off to an upbeat start. Analysts on average see S&P 500 earnings climbing 9.3% in the third quarter, an improvement from expectations of 8.8% at the start of October, according to LSEG I/B/E/S.
Following a rally of nearly 14% in 2025, the S&P 500 is valued at 23 times expected earnings, its priciest level in five years.
The S&P 500 climbed 0.53% to end the session at 6,664.01 points.
The Nasdaq gained 0.52% to 22,679.98 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.52% to 46,190.61 points.
Nine of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes rose, led by consumer staples, up 1.23%.
For the week, the S&P 500 gained 1.7%, the Nasdaq rose 2.1% and the Dow climbed 1.6%.
The CBOE volatility index, investors' fear gauge, dropped to 21.5 points after hitting its highest level in nearly six months at 28.99 earlier in the day.
Wall Street's most valuable companies were mixed, with Tesla rising 2.5%, Apple adding almost 2% and Amazon falling 0.7%. Eli Lilly fell 2% after Trump said he would bring down prices of weight-loss drugs. State Street dropped 1.4% after the bank's third-quarter net interest income missed estimates.
Advancing issues outnumbered falling ones within the S&P 500 by a 2.6-to-one ratio.
The S&P 500 posted 7 new highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 37 new highs and 114 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was relatively light, with 19.6 billion shares traded, compared with an average of 20.7 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.
