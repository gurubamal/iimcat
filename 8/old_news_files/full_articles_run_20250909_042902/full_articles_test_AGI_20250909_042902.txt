Agilent Technologies India and the ICAR-National Research Centre for Grapes (NRCG), Pune, have announced the next phase of their collaboration to strengthen India’s food safety infrastructure through advanced analytical science and regulatory engagement.
The initiative aims to unlock new market opportunities by enhancing transparency and trust in quality assurance. With agricultural exports on the rise, the demand for reliable, scalable, and regulation-ready food testing solutions has increased.
As part of the collaboration, Agilent and NRCG will co-develop targeted workflows for pesticide residue and fumigant analysis, focusing on sustainability, precision, and alignment with global regulations. These efforts are intended to support laboratories and stakeholders in meeting evolving safety standards while boosting confidence in India’s food supply chain.

The partnership will also provide a platform for deeper engagement with the scientific and regulatory community. Joint workshops, webinars, and technical publications are planned to encourage knowledge exchange and promote best practices in analytical testing. The initiatives will help build capacity among food safety professionals and drive the adoption of validated methods across government and commercial laboratories.
Nandakumar Kalathil, Country General Manager, Agilent Technologies India, added, “We are proud to expand our collaboration with NRCG and contribute to the development of resilient, future-ready food safety systems. This partnership is not just about technology—it’s about building trust, enabling transformation, and supporting India’s role as a global leader in safe food production.”
Dr. Kaushik Banerjee, Director of ICAR-NRCG, stated, “This partnership is a natural progression of our shared vision to elevate food safety standards in India. By integrating Agilent’s technological capabilities with NRCG’s research leadership, we are creating a framework that supports innovation, regulatory compliance, and stakeholder empowerment.”
