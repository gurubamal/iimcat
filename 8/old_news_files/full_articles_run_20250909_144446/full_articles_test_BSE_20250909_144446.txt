Speaking to ET Now, Ramamurthy highlighted that India’s GDP growth of 7.8% in the last quarter reflects rising demand and effective policy reforms, including GST, tax cuts, and structural changes. “India is in a very important position globally with its consumption story, rising middle class, and energy independence drive. The growth momentum is here to stay,” he said.
On concerns around persistent selling by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), Ramamurthy pointed to strong support from domestic institutional investors (DIIs) and retail investors. “If FPIs sell Rs 7,000 crore, DIIs are ready to buy Rs 10,000 crore. This financial muscle comes from mutual fund inflows, driven by household savings. Indian markets today are resilient, unlike earlier times when global shocks had a bigger impact,” he explained.
Deepening vital for market strength
Ramamurthy also spoke about BSE’s efforts to deepen the derivatives market. With expiry day changes and an increase in non-expiry week contracts, he noted growing participation. “We are seeing 3–5% growth in volumes from next-week and monthly contracts. This deepening is vital for market strength,” he said.On the IPO pipeline, Ramamurthy said India has raised around $10 billion through IPOs in the last eight months, with $15 billion already approved by SEBI and another $20 billion in the pipeline. He stressed the importance of SME listings, noting that over 600 SMEs have already listed, with the last 100 raising Rs 4,000 crore in fresh capital.
The mutual fund industry, he added, has also seen rapid growth. Monthly orders have tripled in the last 30 months, crossing 6.5 crore orders per month. With India’s young population and rising financialisation, he expects mutual funds to continue expanding beyond the top 30 cities.
“Good times lie ahead for equity markets. I am born positive,” Ramamurthy said, underlining his optimism for both the economy and markets.

Title   : Auto demand set for festival boost; BSE, CAMS good long-term bets: Neeraj Dewan

“The last buyback was at Rs 1,850, but the stock didn’t do much after that. This time, valuations are better, and the stock has been at low levels for a while. Depending on the buyback premium, there’s an arbitrage opportunity, and the stock should form a base here with attractive long-term valuations,” Dewan told ET Now.
Railway stocks, particularly RailTel, have also been in focus with fresh order wins, including a Rs 700 crore order from the Education Council of Bihar. Dewan believes the sector is positioned for a healthier phase after a prolonged consolidation.
“Railway stocks had rallied sharply last year and became expensive, so consolidation was needed. RailTel and others corrected a lot, but with improving order books and better valuations, there’s now a case for stock-specific investment. Over the next year or so, upside potential looks good,” he explained.
On the broader fundamentals, Dewan noted that the base has already been established. “These stocks have made a base, so a big downside looks unlikely. Consolidation is done, valuations are attractive, and last quarter results were not as bad as feared. With a couple of good quarters, growth will be clearer. In the short to medium term, there’s a case for accumulation.”
The auto sector has also been buzzing after GST rate cuts, strong monsoons, and hopes of festive season demand. Dewan highlighted that recent corrections created solid entry points.
“In recent months, we recommended Bajaj Auto and Hero Moto after sharp corrections. Those were good entry points around Rs 8,200 for Bajaj Auto and below Rs 5,000 for Hero. Even now, long-term investors can look at M&M and TVS, which have shown strong performance. GST cuts, good monsoons, and lower rates should boost demand, especially during the festival season,” he said.
Turning to capital market-linked stocks, Dewan pointed to BSE, NAM, and CAMS as attractive long-term bets.
“These stocks corrected due to expiry-related talks, but volumes should normalise. I like BSE at current levels for the long term. NAM has also done well, and CAMS, now at a reasonable PE after correction, looks attractive. A basket of BSE, NAM, and CAMS would be a good long-term investment,” he added.
From IT majors like Infosys to railway plays and auto leaders, Dewan sees attractive opportunities for long-term investors across multiple segments of the market.
