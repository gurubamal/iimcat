Venturi Partners, a consumer growth fund, has announced the first close of its second fund at $150 million.
The fund, which has a total target corpus of $225 million, saw investments from existing and new investors. Venturi aims to make the final close of the fund by June 2026.
The VC firm noted that Fund II will make initial investments of $15-40 million in 10 companies across high-growth consumer sectors.
The growth-stage venture capital firm, which has invested in start-ups, including Country Delight and Cure.fit, said alongside the main fund, investors will also be able to co-invest on a 1-1 ratio.
This investment strategy is reinforced by Venturi’s distinct value creation approach that lies in its close collaboration with founders and active board level participation, by leveraging the team’s deep sector operating expertise.
Nicholas Cator, Founder & Managing Partner of Venturi Partners, commented: “We are grateful for the continued trust and confidence of our existing investors and welcome our new partners. This strong response validates our investment thesis and the strength of the unique team that we have built over the last five years.”
Venturi Partners closed its debut fund in 2022, with a target corpus of $180 million, backed by prominent families in Europe and Asia, including Frédéric de Mévius (AB InBev family) and Ackermans & van Haaren, a listed Belgian investment company. Its Fund I portfolio includes Livspace, Pickup Coffee, K-12 Techno Services, and others, with its final eighth investment yet to be announced.
Rishika Chandan, Managing Partner of Venturi Partners, said: “Amidst global volatility, India continues to emerge as a strong growth market, creating a compelling long-term investment opportunity that aligns well with our strategy. With our hands-on operating expertise, we are confident we will deliver strong returns.”
This comes at a time when venture capital fund-raising in India has picked up after a year-long lull. Recently, Accel and Bessemer Venture Partners, as well as domestic names such as Prime Venture Partners and Cornerstone VC, have closed funds.
The move comes amid a fundamental re-set in Indian venture capital as large pools of private growth capital have dried up, forcing start-ups to increasingly look to the public markets for scale and liquidity.

Chennai and US-based SaaS unicorn Chargebee has expanded with a new office at WeWork Ramanujan Intellon Park, Chennai.
The office expansion comes after Chargebee had completed acquisitions of Trainn, a SaaS start-up that creates hyper-personalised videos for customer training purposes and payment platform Inai Technologies, earlier in the year.
The managed space spanning over 22,700 sq ft will be Chargebee’s second office with WeWork India, following an existing workspace at Prestige Tech Park, Bengaluru.
“Chargebee’s move to expand its office footprint in partnership with WeWork India, particularly with our Chennai and Bengaluru hubs, signals our alignment with our Adaptive Workplace Model, reflecting the evolving nature of work in an AI-driven world, where collaboration, creativity, and momentum thrive best through shared space and real-time connection, ” Rajaraman Santhanam, Chief Product Officer and Co-founder at Chargebee, said in a statement.
