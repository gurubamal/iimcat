These stocks will trade ex-dividend tomorrow, Thursday, September 4, 2025, which is the record date set to determine eligible shareholders.
Oil India has announced a final dividend of 15%, amounting to Rs 1.5 per share. NTPC has declared a 33.5% final dividend at Rs 3.35 per share, while ONGC will pay a 25% final dividend of Rs 1.25 per share.
These dividend announcements make PSU stocks attractive to income-focused investors, especially given their consistent payout history and relatively stable fundamentals.
Investors purchasing shares today will have them credited to their demat accounts in time for the record date, thereby qualifying for the dividend benefit. Missing today's trading window means forfeiting eligibility, regardless of future holdings.
