Tyremaker CEAT is aiming to get a quarter of its revenues from the international markets with Camso integration.
The company recently announced the completion of the acquisition of Michelin Group’s CAMSO Construction Compact Line Business, including Sri Lanka’s Midigama plant and Casting Product plant in Kotugoda.
CEAT is also investing $171 million in Sri Lanka. With the acquisition, the company has integrated the CAMSO brand into its Off-Highway Tyres (OHT) strategy.
“The revenue share will be 25 per cent. Once the Camso brand is fully integrated, we will take control of the entire supply chain, which could happen between 4 and 6 quarters. It could contribute 10 to 15 per cent to start in the top line if we utilise the capacity fully to this ratio. The bottom line impact in terms of margin accretion etcetera would take some time to kick in. It will be overall margin accretive for us because this business is inherently in the high teens close to 20 per cent,” said Arnab Banerjee, MD & CEO, CEAT.
Camso is a premium brand in construction equipment tyres and tracks with strong equity in the EU and North American aftermarket and OE segments.
“We also have domestic business growing very strongly, so it will not be pro rata. The international business will inch up and there will be strong growth in Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) and replacement in the domestic business,” added Arnab Banerjee.
