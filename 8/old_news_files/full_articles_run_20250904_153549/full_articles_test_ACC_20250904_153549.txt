The Ahmedabad-based company plans to raise up to Rs 143 crore through a fresh issue of 23.5 million equity shares. At the upper end of the price band, the IPO values the company at a post-issue market capitalization of about Rs 550 crore.
According to the company’s prospectus, bids can be made for a minimum lot size of 235 shares, translating to Rs 13,160 at the lower band and Rs 14,335 at the upper band. Retail investors can apply for up to 13 lots, while HNIs and institutional investors will have higher bidding limits.
As per the allocation structure, 75% of the offer is reserved for Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs), 15% for Non-Institutional Investors (NIIs), and 10% for retail investors. In addition, employees and existing shareholders of Dev Information Technology have reserved quotas.

Dev Accelerator positions itself as an integrated workspace solutions provider, catering to corporates, start-ups, and individuals.

Dev Accelerator Ltd, which provides flexible office spaces, on Thursday fixed a price band of ₹56 to ₹61 per share for its upcoming ₹143-crore initial public offering (IPO).

The company's IPO is entirely a fresh issue of 2.47 crore equity shares worth ₹143 crore at the upper end of the price band.
The company plans to utilise proceeds for "fit-outs" in the new centres and their security deposits; payment of debt; and general corporate purposes, including strategic initiatives, strengthening marketing capabilities, brand building exercises and payment of lease liabilities.
This capital infusion will enable DevX to expand its footprint in major cities, including Mumbai, Gurugram, Noida, Pune, Chennai, GIFT City, Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Rajkot, Surat, Goa, and Jaipur.
As of August 31, 2024, DevX had 25 centres in more than 10 cities, including Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Hyderabad, Delhi, and Udaipur.
The company said 75 per cent of the issue size has been reserved for qualified institutional buyers, 15 per cent for non-institutional investors and the remaining 10 per cent for retail investors.
Further, investors can bid for one lot of 235 shares and in multiples of 235 thereafter.
