The DPIIT on Monday announced the launch of PM GatiShakti -- Offshore, a digital platform developed for the integrated planning and management of offshore projects like wind farms, marine resource exploration, and coastal infrastructure development.
The platform provides a unified geospatial interface that consolidates critical data sets from multiple government ministries and departments to enable data-driven decision-making.
It aims to strengthen India's Blue economy and support the nation's transition toward green energy and sustainable coastal growth, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) said.
Citing an example, it said that while planning offshore power transmission routes, the platform can integrate datasets from multiple ministries, including power, petroleum and natural gas, environment and telecommunications.
In the case of a proposed High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) subsea link connecting the Indian mainland with the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, data can be analysed to identify optimal seabed depths for cost-effective cable laying, while ecological layers, such as coral reefs, mangroves, and turtle nesting zones, can help avoid environmentally sensitive areas.
"PM GatiShakti - Offshore is a pioneering initiative under the PM GatiShakti Programme, developed as a digital platform for the integrated planning and management of offshore development," it said.
The portal would have detailed data sets on offshore wind, solar, tidal, wave, and ocean thermal energy potential; oil and gas fields and pipelines; bathymetry and sedimentary basins; coastal regulation zones; coral reefs, mangroves, and marine mammal areas; ports, airports, power infrastructure, and fish landing centers; along with oceanographic and hazard indicators, such as surface currents, wave heights, and earthquake risk zones.
"Collectively, these layers provide planners, regulators, and investors with critical insights for sustainable and technically sound decision-making," it said.
Meanwhile, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal launched the Logistics Excellence, Advancement, and Performance Shield (LEAPS) 2025.
LEAPS is a flagship initiative of the department, and it aims to benchmark logistics excellence, strengthen India's competitiveness, and align with the vision of the National Logistics Policy (NLP) and PM GatiShakti.
Registrations for LEAPS are now open on the Rashtriya Puraskar Portal (https://awards.gov.in/). Interested applicants can submit their entries by November 15.
Applications are invited across 13 categories, including air and road freight service providers; multimodal transport operators; warehouse service providers (agriculture); education institute promoting the logistics sector; and logistics service delivery for e-commerce operations.

Recognising young leaders and entrepreneurs, Hurun India recently released the latest “Under 35” list as a part of the Avendus Wealth – Hurun India Uth Series 2025. Although several of India’s top business leaders have built successful empires but some exercise more influence and social media dominance than others.
Neither Physics Wallah's Alakh Pandey, nor Meesho's Vidit Aatrey topped in terms of digital reach. The highest rank in “The Most Followed Minds of India’s U35 Club” was secured by 32-year-old billionaire Ritesh Agarwal of PRISM with 13.22 lakh LinkedIn followers. Occupying the second spot, Alakh Pandey boasts 4.65 lakh followers while Vidit Aatrey secured the third position with 3.01 followers.

The founder and CEO of hospitality chain named PRISM, Ritesh Agarwal's fame can be attributed to his appearance as a panellist on Shark Tank India Season 3 in 2024.

Celebrating the country’s young-seasoned entrepreneurs and next-generation leaders, Hurun India listed Ritesh Agarwal at 6th spot as one of the “Most Experienced U35 Leaders.” Another remarkable achievement of the company run by Odisha born businessman was that of securing second spot among the maximum number of “Funding Rounds Driven by U35 Startups.” Furthermore, PRISM dominates the U35-led startup landscape in terms of the “Most Funded U35 Startups.” Ritesh Agarwal's PRISM raised $3.7 bilion in equity funding in the year in consideration.
His LinkedIn profile description states, “With the early support of The Thiel Fellowship, I have been able to innovate and disrupt the hospitality industry. Seeking to bring budget accommodation for travellers that can be booked instantly, Ritesh boasts "skills in customer relationship management, strategic partnerships, and leadership, while expanding PRISM's presence across 35 countries.”
