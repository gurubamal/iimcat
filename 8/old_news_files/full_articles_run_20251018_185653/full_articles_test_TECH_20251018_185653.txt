--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The net sales were posted at Rs 19,371 crore in Q2FY26, versus Rs 15,967 crore in the same quarter last year.
UltraTech Cement reported a robust 22.3% growth in domestic grey cement sales during the September 2025 quarter, excluding contributions from its newly acquired India Cements and Kesoram assets, which were not part of the company in the year-ago period.
This performance far exceeded the industry average growth of around 5%, underscoring UltraTech’s strong market position and operational execution.
The company benefited from a 7% year-on-year decline in energy costs, though raw material expenses rose 5% due to higher prices of flyash and slag. For its existing operations, operating EBITDA per ton stood at Rs 966, based on a capacity of 166.76 mtpa.
The recently acquired assets of India Cements and Kesoram generated operating EBITDA of Rs 386 per ton and Rs 755 per ton, respectively. Integration progress has been swift, with 55% of Kesoram’s volumes and 31% of India Cements’ volumes already transitioned under the UltraTech brand.
“UltraTech’s expansion program is progressing as scheduled, with the Company continuously enhancing its production capabilities. UltraTech’s domestic grey cement capacity is 186.86 mtpa, on a consolidated basis. Together with its overseas capacity of 5.4 mtpa, the Company’s global capacity stands at 192.26 mtpa. UltraTech also migrated to the GST 2.0 framework effective September 22, 2025, ensuring that customers receive the full benefit of the reduction in GST rates,” the company said while commenting on its capacity expansion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have Kalyan Jewellers India shares. My average purchase price is ₹506. Shall I continue to hold the stock or exit?
Anjali, Chennai
Kalyan Jewellers India (₹489.80): The immediate outlook is slightly unclear. Supports are at ₹440 and ₹410. Resistance is at around ₹550. A breakout on either side of ₹410 or ₹550 will determine the next leg of move. A break above ₹550 will be bullish to see a rise to ₹650. A further break above ₹650 is needed to go back up to ₹800 levels again. On the other hand, a break below ₹410 will be bearish.
Such a break can drag the stock down to ₹320-300. Keep a stop-loss at ₹390 and hold the stock. Trail the stop-loss up to ₹520 when the price goes up to ₹570. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹560 and ₹600 when the price touches ₹590 and ₹620 respectively. Exit the stock at ₹640. If the stock declines below ₹410, adhere to the stop-loss and exit with a loss.
I have bought Man Infraconstruction shares at ₹188. What is the long-term outlook?
Ummachan Thomas
Man Infraconstruction (₹144.45): The short-term outlook is bearish. The stock can fall to ₹130 or ₹120 from here. The region around ₹120 is a strong long-term support where the fall can halt. A fresh leg of rally anywhere from the ₹130-120 region can take the stock up to ₹220-250 over the next one year. This uptrend may also have the potential to target ₹320 on the upside eventually.
Accumulate at ₹135. Keep the stop-loss at ₹105. Move the stop-loss up to ₹165 as soon as the stock goes up to ₹200. Revise the stop-loss up to ₹210 and ₹240 when the price touches ₹235 and ₹280 respectively. Exit the stock at ₹310. The bullish view will go wrong if the stock breaks below ₹120. In that case, a fall to ₹100-₹90 can be seen.
I have shares of IKIO Technologies. My purchase price is ₹330. Shall I continue to hold the stock or exit?
Valliappan A, Chennai
IKIO Technologies (₹208.90): The stock has been in a down trend ever since it got listed in June 2023. There is no sign of a trend reversal. Strong resistances are at ₹250 and ₹285. The stock has to ideally rise above ₹285 to indicate a bullish trend reversal. Only then a rise to ₹350 and higher levels will come into the picture. Support is around ₹185. A break below it will increase the danger of the price falling towards ₹140-₹130.
It is better to exit the stock and accept the loss rather than waiting for a bounce. You can consider reinvesting the sale proceeds into some other stock. Maybe you can consider Man Infraconstruction stock explained in the previous query. Buy the stock and also keep the stop-loss at the levels mentioned. Follow the same strategy.
I have bought GoodLuck India shares at ₹822. Shall I continue to hold or book profit? What is the outlook?
Pavan Varma
GoodLuck India (₹1,241.60): The trend is up and strong. Immediate support is at ₹1,185. Below that, ₹1,110 is the next strong support. As long as the stock stays above these supports, the long-term outlook will remain bullish. GoodLuck India stock has potential to target ₹1,650 or even ₹1,800 over the next one year or so. You can exit 25 per cent of your holding at current levels and book some profits.
Keep a stop-loss at ₹1,080 for the balance. Move the stop-loss up to ₹1,180 as soon as the stock goes up to ₹1,420. Revise the stop-loss further up to ₹1,460 and ₹1,510 when the price touches ₹1,530 and ₹1,600 respectively. Exit 50 per cent of the balance holdings at ₹1,650 and keep the stop-loss at ₹1,590 for the rest. Sell the remaining shares at ₹1,780.

Title   : UltraTech Cement Q2 profit misses analyst estimate on lower volumes and higher costs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UltraTech Cement Ltd, India’s largest cementmaker, reported a sharp decline in net profit for the September quarter sequentially owing to lower volumes and higher fixed costs.
The Aditya Birla Group’s cement arm reported a consolidated net profit of ₹1,238 crore for the quarter, an almost 45% drop compared to the first quarter of FY26, according to the company’s exchange filings. It fell short of Bloomberg's estimate of ₹1,456 crore based on a poll of 19 analysts.
Higher fixed costs such as cost of materials and employee costs, combined with lower sales volumes, hurt profitability, dragging the Ebitda per tonne down sequentially.
“Maintenance, advertising, and staff costs were slightly higher this quarter, contributing to a delta impact of around ₹200 per tonne. Some of these costs, however, will moderate next quarter,” Atul Daga, chief financial officer at UltraTech said in a post-earnings call with analysts, adding that lower quarter-on-quarter sales volumes impacted operating leverage.
Satyadeep Jain, Lead Analyst for Cement, Metals, Mining & Utilities at Ambit Capital, said, “The actual numbers came in below expectations. The drop in profit was driven by a combination of factors such as pricing pressure, higher raw material, power and fuel costs, lower volumes, which increased fixed cost per ton, higher maintenance costs, and the usual July wage hike and bonus payments at UltraTech.
"On the other hand, the company's year-on-year profit growth was supported by a rebound in cement prices from last year's lows and gains from acquisitions.”
The company’s raw material costs rose by almost 1% and employee costs by almost 10% for the second quarter of FY26 compared to the previous quarter. Revenue from operations fell almost 8% sequentially to ₹19,607 crore in the September quarter.
However, revenue from operations grew 20% year-on-year on account of higher pricing compared to last year and acquisition gains. This growth is due in part to UltraTech’s consolidation moves.
The company restated its previous results following the merger of Kesoram Industries’ cement division with effect from 1 April 2024. During the year, it also acquired 75.6% of The India Cements and completed the purchase of Birla White Wallcare Pvt Ltd for ₹234 crore, according to notes accompanying its financials. These results, therefore, are not directly comparable with the prior period.
The cementmaker also announced a fresh investment of ₹10,255 crore to expand its cement production capacity by 22.8 million tonnes per annum, including that of its subsidiary India Cements Limited, according to a company statement.
This expansion will be executed through a mix of brownfield and greenfield projects. Commercial production from these new capacities will begin in phases from FY28, taking the company’s total global cement capacity to 240.76 mtpa.
“Our expansion plans are in full swing, and we expect to finish this financial year with 200 million tonnes of capacity”, said Daga. Major projects such as Vadhavan Port, Amravati, the new Mumbai airport development, upcoming data centers, urban real estate projects, and Google’s $15 billion AI hub in Andhra Pradesh are all driving consistent growth and demand in the cement industry, he added.
Daga also highlighted that GST 2.0 is expected to boost demand for premium cement as more customers will be able to afford their aspirational brands. The company aimed to consolidate presence in the southern markets in FY25, and is now focusing on expanding further in the northern and western regions.
“With an intent to further strengthen our position in these markets, we are embarking on the next phase of our growth with 22.8 million tonnes of incremental capacity which is a mix of largely brownfield and some greenfield expansions. Out of this 22.8 million tonnes, 18 million tonnes is focused on the northern markets, and 4.8 million tonnes for the western markets,” Daga said.
In August Aditya Birla Group and UltraTech Cement chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said at the company’s annual general meeting it would end FY26 with 200 million tonnes per annum of capacity, a year ahead of its original guidance of FY27. Managing director K.C. Jhanwar said in his message to shareholders in the annual report that it planned to invest ₹9,000-10,000 crore in capex in FY26.
UltraTech’s domestic grey cement capacity is 186.86 mtpa and with its overseas capacity of 5.4 mtpa, total capacity stands at 192.26 mtpa.
Daga said he expected rural markets to be a key demand driver In the second half of 2025. Jhawar added that the housing sector, particularly rural housing, has seen strong demand, supported by a good monsoon and revised minimum support prices for farmers. On the urban side, changes in personal income tax rates and favourable interest rates are expected to give momentum to demand.

Kumar Mangalam Birla, Chairman, Aditya Birla Group said the latest capacity expansion follows over ₹50,000 crore invested over the past five years.
The investment reflects the company’s confidence in the Indian economy and the scale of its infrastructure ambitions, he said.
When capital is deployed strategically, it energises ecosystems, deepens industrial linkages and creates durable employment, he added.
As India enters a transformative era of infrastructure and economic development, UltraTech is well-positioned to meet the rising demand for cement, he said.
