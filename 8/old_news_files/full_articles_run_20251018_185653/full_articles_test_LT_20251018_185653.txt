--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Corporate restructuring in India has historically been a tribunal-centric process. Sections 230-232 of the Companies Act, 2013 require National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approval for mergers, demergers and compromises. While this framework is intended to bring judicial scrutiny and credibility to such transactions, it has also resulted in delays, high transaction costs, and unpredictable timeline for completion.
In 2005, the JJ Irani Committee recommended contractual mergers without court intervention, which was incorporated in the Companies Act, 2013 as section 233, envisaging a fast-track route for certain companies. However, the Companies (Compromises, Arrangements and Amalgamations) Rules, 2016 confined its scope to small companies, start-ups and mergers between a holding company and its wholly-owned subsidiary.
The 2025 amendment
On September 4, 2025, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs issued Notification G.S.R. 603(E), amending the CAA Rules to expand the scope of section 233. The fast-track route is now available to a wider class of unlisted companies and, for the first time, expressly covers demergers. Procedural requirements such as notices and filings have been simplified, with approvals routed through the regional director. Safeguards remain: only unlisted companies with borrowings up to ₹200 crore and no default are eligible, certified by an auditor in Form CAA.10A; a solvency declaration in Form CAA.10 and a registered valuer’s report are mandatory; and sectoral regulators and stock exchanges must be notified where applicable. The continued requirement of 90 per cent shareholder and creditor approval ensures that stakeholder rights are protected. These changes signal a policy shift towards handling routine restructuring through an administrative route rather than judicial. While these changes are welcome, they remain piecemeal. The underlying logic of section 233 — that uncontested restructurings need not clog judicial forums — applies equally to all M&As, not merely to small companies or a limited class of transactions.
For businesses, the amendment promises shorter timelines, lower costs, and greater certainty in execution. For investors, it adds predictability to the M&A landscape. For regulators, it places greater responsibility on regional directors, who must now balance speed with scrutiny. For the NCLT, it holds the prospect of a lighter docket, freeing judicial time for complex, contested disputes and insolvency cases.
The statistics are telling. As of March 31, 2025, the NCLT had 1,088 merger and amalgamation matters pending, in addition to 6,885 other company law cases. This pendency reflects a sustained inflow of cases, underscoring the need to free the Tribunal’s limited time for matters of greater judicial importance.
A broader reform imperative
In the UK, schemes of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act, 2006 involve two hearings — one to convene meetings and another to sanction the scheme. The court’s function is supervisory rather than substantive. Once statutory majorities are achieved and the scheme is fair and procedurally compliant, sanction follows as a matter of course. The court does not re-examine commercial judgment or the merits of the restructuring. The Supreme Court’s decision in Miheer H Mafatlal v Mafatlal (1997) embodies this very principle. The Court held that once the statutory majority has approved a scheme with full disclosure, valuation has been carried out by recognised experts, and there is no fraud or illegality, judicial interference is limited. Courts are not to act as appellate bodies over business wisdom. The ratio thus delineates a narrow judicial function, confined to questions of fairness, transparency and legality, and excludes any review of commercial merits.
In practice before the NCLT, however, the process has evolved differently. When the regional director (RD) raises objections and the companies submit replies, the matter should ordinarily proceed to adjudication by the NCLT. Instead, the RD is directed to file a supplementary affidavit, and the scheme is sanctioned only if all explanations are accepted by the RD. If sanction for the scheme depends solely on the RD’s complete no-objection, the exercise ceases to be one of judicial scrutiny or judgment and becomes an administrative endorsement.
Therefore, the time has come to transfer the entire mergers and amalgamations portfolio from the NCLT to the RDs, except where objections are raised by shareholders, creditors, regulators or any stakeholder. Only contested schemes warrant judicial determination by NCLT. This bifurcation will restore the NCLT’s role as a tribunal for disputes, while allowing routine corporate reorganisations to proceed efficiently through the administrative route. Since uncontested cases involve procedural scrutiny alone, RDs may in fact be better placed than the NCLT to process them efficiently.
The fast-track mechanism carries risks that must be recognised if the reform is to succeed.
Minority shareholder protection: Section 233 allows objections, but compressed timelines demand vigilance to ensure their interests are safeguarded effectively.
Creditor safeguards: The notice-and-objection process under Form CAA-9 remain robust and transparent, and creditors are not prejudiced by silence or delay.
Administrative capacity: Regional Directors’ capacity must be strengthened. This is largely a question of staffing and resources.
Regulatory arbitrage: Companies may attempt to structure transactions artificially to qualify for the fast-track route. Clear eligibility norms and vigilant oversight by the MCA are essential to prevent misuse.
The 2025 amendment to section 233 is both timely and ambitious. It acknowledges the unsustainable burden on the NCLT and redirects simpler restructuring matters to an administrative channel. If implemented with care, it could make India a more M&A-friendly jurisdiction, institutionalising a framework where court approval is reserved for contentious or public interest cases.
The real reform lies ahead. By transferring all uncontested mergers and amalgamations to the RDs, and reserving the NCLT route only for contests or objections, India can achieve efficiency and fairness. Unless the design changes, pendency will remain the rule. The amendment should therefore be seen as the beginning of this journey, not its end.
