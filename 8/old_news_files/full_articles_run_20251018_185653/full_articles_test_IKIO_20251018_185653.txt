--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have Kalyan Jewellers India shares. My average purchase price is ₹506. Shall I continue to hold the stock or exit?
Anjali, Chennai
Kalyan Jewellers India (₹489.80): The immediate outlook is slightly unclear. Supports are at ₹440 and ₹410. Resistance is at around ₹550. A breakout on either side of ₹410 or ₹550 will determine the next leg of move. A break above ₹550 will be bullish to see a rise to ₹650. A further break above ₹650 is needed to go back up to ₹800 levels again. On the other hand, a break below ₹410 will be bearish.
Such a break can drag the stock down to ₹320-300. Keep a stop-loss at ₹390 and hold the stock. Trail the stop-loss up to ₹520 when the price goes up to ₹570. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹560 and ₹600 when the price touches ₹590 and ₹620 respectively. Exit the stock at ₹640. If the stock declines below ₹410, adhere to the stop-loss and exit with a loss.
I have bought Man Infraconstruction shares at ₹188. What is the long-term outlook?
Ummachan Thomas
Man Infraconstruction (₹144.45): The short-term outlook is bearish. The stock can fall to ₹130 or ₹120 from here. The region around ₹120 is a strong long-term support where the fall can halt. A fresh leg of rally anywhere from the ₹130-120 region can take the stock up to ₹220-250 over the next one year. This uptrend may also have the potential to target ₹320 on the upside eventually.
Accumulate at ₹135. Keep the stop-loss at ₹105. Move the stop-loss up to ₹165 as soon as the stock goes up to ₹200. Revise the stop-loss up to ₹210 and ₹240 when the price touches ₹235 and ₹280 respectively. Exit the stock at ₹310. The bullish view will go wrong if the stock breaks below ₹120. In that case, a fall to ₹100-₹90 can be seen.
I have shares of IKIO Technologies. My purchase price is ₹330. Shall I continue to hold the stock or exit?
Valliappan A, Chennai
IKIO Technologies (₹208.90): The stock has been in a down trend ever since it got listed in June 2023. There is no sign of a trend reversal. Strong resistances are at ₹250 and ₹285. The stock has to ideally rise above ₹285 to indicate a bullish trend reversal. Only then a rise to ₹350 and higher levels will come into the picture. Support is around ₹185. A break below it will increase the danger of the price falling towards ₹140-₹130.
It is better to exit the stock and accept the loss rather than waiting for a bounce. You can consider reinvesting the sale proceeds into some other stock. Maybe you can consider Man Infraconstruction stock explained in the previous query. Buy the stock and also keep the stop-loss at the levels mentioned. Follow the same strategy.
I have bought GoodLuck India shares at ₹822. Shall I continue to hold or book profit? What is the outlook?
Pavan Varma
GoodLuck India (₹1,241.60): The trend is up and strong. Immediate support is at ₹1,185. Below that, ₹1,110 is the next strong support. As long as the stock stays above these supports, the long-term outlook will remain bullish. GoodLuck India stock has potential to target ₹1,650 or even ₹1,800 over the next one year or so. You can exit 25 per cent of your holding at current levels and book some profits.
Keep a stop-loss at ₹1,080 for the balance. Move the stop-loss up to ₹1,180 as soon as the stock goes up to ₹1,420. Revise the stop-loss further up to ₹1,460 and ₹1,510 when the price touches ₹1,530 and ₹1,600 respectively. Exit 50 per cent of the balance holdings at ₹1,650 and keep the stop-loss at ₹1,590 for the rest. Sell the remaining shares at ₹1,780.
