Spelling some relief for Indian seafood exporters hit by US tariffs, the EU has approved 102 additional Indian fishery establishments for export to the bloc, which is likely to immediately increase exports of the item to the bloc by 20 per cent, according to the government.
Simultaneously, there is positive movement in the India-EU free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations taking place in New Delhi this week with things progressing fast, Commerce & Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said.
“This (the decision on listing 102 new fishery units) follows a series of meetings in the EU and New Delhi, in which the Union Minister of Commerce and Industry and senior officials participated… Reflects India’s commitment to food safety, traceability and compliance with EU regulations and strengthens its position as a trusted supplier of high-quality seafood,” per a government statement.
India’s annual export of seafood to the EU, currently at $1.1 billion, is expected to immediately increase 20 per cent, and subsequently it would increase further, an official said.
The items that are expected to benefit include aquaculture shrimps, squid, cuttle fish, octopus and sea cod, according to the Commerce Department.
As India’s seafood export to the US, the biggest market for Indian fish exporters, is set to take a big hit because of the 50 per cent tariffs imposed on Indian goods, the EU’s move is especially welcome. India’s shrimp exports in 2024-25 was $4.88 billion, accounting for 66 per cent of the total seafood exports.
The EU is the second largest importer of Indian seafood exports, while other significant markets include China, Japan, Vietnam and Thailand.
“The approval given by the EU to 102 Indian fishery establishments, some of which were earlier denotified, demonstrates the confidence the bloc is expressing in India’s quality adherence. Coming at a time when exporters are facing trouble in the US, it is a relief,” the official said.
India-EU FTA talk
On the India-EU FTA talks, Goyal said that talks were progressing fast.
“By the time my counterparts Maros Sefcovic, the EU Trade Commissioner and EU Agriculture Commissioner Christophe, come to India, I think we will be quite set to try and conclude the agreement substantially,” Goyal told reporters on Tuesday.
Sefcovic and Hansen are likely to visit India this week.
India and the EU are trying to wrap up the FTA talks substantially by the year-end. An FTA with the EU will help India diversify its exports more as it tries to find markets for its exports hit by US tariffs.
