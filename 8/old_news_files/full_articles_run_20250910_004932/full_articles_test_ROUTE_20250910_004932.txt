Kott Ventures Pvt Ltd, the Kochi-based natural food and beverages firm, has launched Routes to Roots, a standalone offline store model to sell its brands which were hitherto available online and other retailers.
The company is into processing natural F&B products and traditional Kerala snacks at its unit in the KINFRA Business Park in Kochi since 2014.
Expansion plan
Niby Kottaram, Managing Director, Kott Ventures, said the first of such stores was opened in Kochi and the company is looking at opening 30 stores across south India by 2027-end, of its own and as franchisees.
The stores will stock nearly 400 organic, natural and traditional products including processed ripe mango (mango bar), local honey, gooseberry bird’s eye chilli drink, Marayoor jaggery, coffee powder without chicory, seeds like chia and quinoa, washed, dried and powdered spices, multi-millets powder, dosa powder, kanjikuttu, healthy bars made with millets and coconut jaggery, frozen products including kumbilappam, chopped raw and ripe jackfruit, tapioca among others.
The products sold in the company’s own brands including Organo, Only Organic and El Natural on www.routestoroots.in were receiving an increasing demand which prompted the company to launch its own stores, he said.
Simi N. Jose, Director, said that since more than 300 products, except millet products, are sourced directly from farmers and processed in the company’s own unit at Kinfra Business Park.
