General Motors Co. is pausing plans to eliminate a shift at its lone pickup-truck assembly plant in Canada, offering a temporary reprieve for hundreds of workers affected by President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
The Detroit-based automaker will keep three shifts at its factory in Oshawa, Ontario, until at least Jan. 30, according to Unifor, which represents workers at the plant that makes the Chevrolet Silverado.
In May, GM said it would cut one shift at the plant “in light of forecasted demand and the evolving trade environment,” and had planned to make the reduction this fall. The company has announced plans to boost Silverado output at a factory in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
The union also said Stellantis NV is bringing back a third shift at its factory in Windsor, Ontario, right across the border from Detroit, in the first quarter of 2026. Production was reduced at that plant, which makes Chrysler minivans and the Dodge Charger Daytona, shortly after Trump imposed tariffs on foreign-made automobiles.
Prime Minister Mark Carney retaliated by placing similar levies on US-made cars and light trucks — but soon after, his government said auto companies would be able to apply for tariff relief as long as they continued producing vehicles and investing in Canada.
Unifor has been pressuring Carney not to sign a trade deal with Trump that would enshrine tariffs on goods made in Canada.
“Auto workers still face a highly precarious situation in Oshawa as well as other auto communities, but it does show that the work our union is doing and the message our members are sending to decision-makers is making a difference,” Unifor National President Lana Payne said in a statement.

Tech and electronics major Apple Inc. is set to launch its latest iPhone series 17 later today, along with a few accessories such as the AirPods Pro 3 and the Apple Watch Ultra 3.
However, there is another aspect looming. Notably, Apple's production line is largely based in China, and with Trump's tariff offensive, it leaned heavily on its India facilities to pick up demand. But that could change.
United States President Donald Trump is insistent that manufacturers start producing in the US, instead of China or India. For customers, especially, this could mean anything from a 40-50 per cent hike in cost to doubling and tripling of prices!
According to an AP report, both Trump and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have repeated what analysts feel is an “unrealistic demand.” Why? For one, it would take years to pull off, and even if achieved, the cost of a full US-made iPhone “would result in a doubling, or even a tripling, of the iPhone's current average price of about $1,000.”
In terms of pricing, the rumour mill is currently churning numbers closer to previous releases, with the base variant at $799 ( ₹79,900) and price hikes between $50-100 estimated for the Air, Pro, and Pro Max models, up to $1,249 (approximately ₹1,45,000).
But, tech analysts have warned that a “full” US-made iPhone could triple prices to $3,500 (around ₹3.1 lakh), CNN reported. Further, CNBC cited a Bank of America Securities official to note that the cost of labour difference between China and the US is dear — $40 ( ₹3,500) per unit in China vs $200 ( ₹17,219) per unit in the US — which could inflate the final cost of a US-made iPhone.
But, US manufacturing is still a long way away. The tariff impact on cost is still closer. According to a Reuters report, citing Rosenblatt Securities' estimates, if Apple chooses to pass down the tariffs to customers, the prices of all its models could jump by at least 43 per cent.
For the base model, that would be a jump from $799 to $1,142 (approximately ₹1,45,000), while the other models increase up to $2,300 (around ₹2 lakh) from $1,249.
Notably, at the recent launch of its new Pixel smartphone, Google did not increase prices. All eyes will thus be on the launch event today to see what route Apple takes.
