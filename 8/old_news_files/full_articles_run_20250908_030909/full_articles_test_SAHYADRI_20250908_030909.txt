After consolidating its farmers’ cooperative model in Maharashtra and expanding to Karnataka with a Farmer Producers’ Company (FPC), Sahyadri Farms has set its sights on other southern states to further its unique farmer-centric model.
Vilas Shinde, Chairman and Managing Director of Sahyadri Farms, said that the focus would be on horticultural areas, especially rainfed regions in all southern states, which have good potential for tropical food crops and vegetables.
“The goal is to connect all fruits through FPCs, moving beyond single-crop focus to 2-3 crops in different seasons to minimise risk. The ultimate aim is to bring all crops of different natures under one value chain, offering consumers and institutional customers a one-stop solution,” he said.
He stated that the horticultural market, valued at ₹18 lakh crore, was largely unorganised.
“Unlike milk, which now has a well-established cooperative ecosystem, the horticultural sector was, by and large, in the unorganised sector,” he said, pointing out that there is a significant opportunity for growth and structured development.
The Maharashtra-based cooperative is looking to go for an IPO for its subsidiary Sahyadri Farms Post Harvest Care, which raised about 700 crore in two funding rounds. “We are planning to take the subsidiary for an initial public offering (IPO) after two years,” he said.
Exports
The FPC, which initially earned 95 per cent of its revenues from exports, has mitigated its business risks by diversifying its export basket to 42 countries and developing its domestic market.
“Out of the ₹1,950 crore revenues, exports contributed 45 per cent. The US contributed to less than 5 per cent of the exports,” he said.
Rajendra Srivastava, Executive Director of the Centre for Business Innovation at the Indian School of Business (ISB), said that it was important for companies to diversify their exports to different geographies in order to derisk their prospects. He also wanted the agri-produce companies to focus on adding value to the produce in order to discover more value and increase shelf-life for the highly perishable horticultural crops.
