Reliance Infrastructure touched an intraday high of Rs 278.95 on the BSE, up Rs 13.25, while Reliance Power rose to Rs 46.22.
Both stocks have been in action lately, amid company-specific developments and news around promoter Anil Ambani.
Reliance Power shares have seen a sharp rally buoyed by positive developments in its renewable energy business. The company recently announced the incorporation of GDL – Reliance Solar Pte Ltd (GRSPL), a new associate company under a joint venture structure in Bhutan.
The joint venture, set up in Gelephu Mindfulness City in Bhutan, is a 50:50 partnership between Green Digital Private Ltd, a state-owned enterprise of the Royal Government of Bhutan, and Reliance Enterprises Private Ltd (REPL).
With this addition, Reliance Power’s combined clean energy pipeline now stands at over 3 GW of solar DC capacity and 3.5 GWh of battery energy storage system (BESS) capacity, consolidating its position as India’s largest integrated solar + BESS player.
Meanwhile, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has questioned several senior executives of the Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group in connection with its probe into alleged money laundering in a Rs 17,000 crore bank loan fraud case. The ED has written to nearly 20 banks seeking details on loans given to Reliance Group companies, including the credit assessments conducted before sanctioning the loans.
State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda are among the lenders the ED has written to, ET reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.
