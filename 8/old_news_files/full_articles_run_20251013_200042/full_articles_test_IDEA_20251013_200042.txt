VIL had filed a fresh petition challenging the Department of Telecommunications’ (DoT) demand of Rs 5,606 crore for the financial year 2016–17, seeking a direction for the DoT to "comprehensively re-assess and reconcile" all AGR dues for the period up to FY 2016–17, in line with the Deduction Verification Guidelines dated February 3, 2020.
The Supreme Court’s deferral follows earlier setbacks for Vodafone Idea and other telecom majors. Earlier this year, the apex court had rejected petitions from VIL and Bharti Airtel seeking rectification of alleged errors in the 2021 order calculating AGR dues.
Government signals possible settlement
Despite the legal roadblocks, the Centre has indicated efforts are underway to find a resolution. Last month, the government told the apex court that "some solution may be required" for Vodafone Idea’s petition. Bloomberg reported on October 6, citing sources, that India is considering a one-time settlement of its longstanding AGR dues from Vodafone Group Plc’s local venture, potentially through a waiver of interest and penalties, followed by concessions on the principal.Officials are reportedly drafting the framework while evaluating measures to prevent legal challenges from other telecom operators with AGR obligations, according to the Bloomberg report. The total dispute amounts to nearly Rs 2 lakh crore.

The delayed hearing adds to the uncertainty surrounding Vodafone Idea’s balance sheet and investor sentiment. As the Supreme Court sets the next date for October 27, investors will be watching closely for any signs of a concrete resolution that could reshape Vodafone Idea’s financial outlook.

The Supreme Court on Monday again deferred hearing Vodafone Idea Ltd’s plea seeking a waiver on its adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues to the government. The matter will now be taken up by the court when it reopens after Diwali.
The court will remain closed on account of Diwali from 20-25 October.
The matter pertains to Vodafone Idea filing a petition last month challenging the Department of Telecommunications’s (DoT) demand for an additional ₹9,450 crore towards AGR dues.
India’s third-largest telecom operator has also sought waiver of interest and penalties on its dues, arguing that the disputed components of the dues have not yet been finalised.
The case was deferred for hearing after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Union government, sought additional time. In response, Chief Justice of India B.R. Gavai asked Mehta to come up with a specific stand and deferred the hearing of the case for a fourth time.
At 12.50pm, Vodafone Idea shares were down 2.88% at ₹8.78 each on NSE, while the Nifty 50 was down 0.41%.

The Supreme Court had in 2020 locked Vodafone Idea’s AGR dues till 2016-17 based on DoT’s calculations, adding that no self-assessment or re-assessment of the dues would be permitted. However, DoT has now sought additional payments for up to 2018-19, Vodafone Idea stated in its petition filed on 8 September.
Of the fresh ₹9,450-crore dues sought, the additional demand raised by DoT from Idea Group and Vodafone Idea (post-merger in August 2018) was ₹2,774 crore, while the demand against Vodafone Group (pre-merger) was ₹6,675 crore, according to the petition.
The department informed the telecom operator that the licence fee dues were calculated with interest and interest on penalty up to October 2019, and were updated up to 31 March 2025, with interest calculated at an annual rate of 8%.
On 19 September, the Supreme Court deferred the hearing to 26 September, but the government sought more time. The case was then deferred to 6 October and 13 October thereafter.
During the 19 September hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said that since the government now holds a significant equity stake in Vodafone Idea, a balanced solution that protects consumer interests was needed.
Vodafone Idea, however, had argued in its amended petition filed on 18 September that the Supreme Court had in 2020 only “directed inclusion of the disputed heads for the computation of AGR. Hence, till date, it cannot be said that there was any default in payment requiring imposition of penalty”.
Later, the company filed an amended petition with the Supreme Court seeking a waiver of penalties and interest on AGR dues, arguing that the disputed components of the dues have yet to be finalised.
According to the amended petition, both DoT and the telecom operator agree that the amounts need to be reconciled, corrected, and finalised. “Till the principal amount payable is not crystallized and finalized, it cannot be said that the petitioner is in default requiring payment of penalty,” Vodafone Idea said in the petition.
Vodafone Idea already owes around ₹83,400 crore in AGR dues to the government, with annual payments of ₹18,000 crore starting March. Including penalties and interest, its total liabilities to the government are estimated at around ₹2 trillion.
Vodafone Idea has previously said that its cash flows were insufficient to pay the dues that have mounted over the years. Vodafone Idea’s former chief executive Akshaya Moondra said in August that early resolution of the AGR dispute was critical for the telecom operator to secure bank funding.
The telecom operator has asked the Supreme Court to quash DoT’s additional demands for FY17 and earlier, and order a comprehensive reassessment and reconciliation of all AGR dues for that period.
It has warned that the hefty liability threatened its survival and “the livelihood of thousands of employees working directly or indirectly” with the company. Vodafone Idea serves about 198 million subscribers and employs more than 18,000 people.

Title   : SC defers till Oct 27 hearing on plea of Vodafone Idea for quashing additional AGR demand

The Supreme Court on Monday deferred to October 27 the hearing on a plea of telecom major Vodafone Idea Ltd. seeking quashing of the Department of Telecommunication's (DoT) additional adjusted gross revenue (AGR) demands for the period up to 2016-17.
AGR is the income figure used to calculate the license fees and spectrum charges that telecom companies must pay to the government.
A bench comprising Chief Justice BR Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran, which was scheduled to hear the plea, was urged by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, that the hearing be deferred and listed on reopening of the court after Diwali vacation.
The bench listed the plea for consideration on October 27.
VIL has filed a fresh plea against the DoT's demand of ₹5,606 crore relating to 2016-17.
Earlier, the Centre said that efforts were underway to arrive at a resolution with the company.
Mehta said the government held nearly 50 per cent equity in Vodafone Idea, making it a direct stakeholder in the operator's survival.
“Some solution may have to be found out, subject to your lordship’s approval. If it can be kept next week, we can think of some solution,” the law officer said.
VIL has sought a direction to the DoT to “comprehensively re-assess and reconcile all AGR dues for the period up to FY 2016-17 following the ‘Deduction Verification Guidelines’” dated February 3, 2020.
Earlier this year, in a setback to telecom majors, including Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, the apex court refused to review its 2021 order rejecting their pleas for rectification of alleged errors in the calculation of AGR dues payable by them.
The telecom companies argued that arithmetical errors in the calculation should be rectified and that there were cases of duplication of entries.
In September 2020, the top court fixed a time frame of 10 years for telecom service providers struggling to pay Rs 93,520 crore of AGR-related dues to clear their outstanding amount to the government.
It said telecom operators should pay 10 per cent of the total dues as demanded by the DoT by March 31, 2021, and the remaining amount would be paid in yearly instalments from April 1, 2021, to March 31, 2031.
The top court, which held the demand raised by the DoT with respect to AGR dues as final, said there should neither be a dispute raised by the telecom companies nor any re-assessment.
The apex court delivered its verdict on the AGR issue in October 2019.
The DoT moved a plea in the top court seeking staggered payment of the dues by telcos over 20 years.
Earlier, AGR included both telecom revenue and non-telecom income (like interest from deposits or asset sales).
In 2021, the rules were relaxed to exclude non-telecom income of AGR, reducing the financial load on operators.
