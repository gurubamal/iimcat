Curie Money, in partnership with ICICI Prudential AMC, has introduced a first-of-its-kind experience that brings together liquid funds, instant redemption, and UPI in one seamless solution.
The collaboration empowers retail investors to grow their money steadily while maintaining instant access—without any lock-ins or penalties.
Liquid Mutual Funds are fast emerging as the preferred option for investors seeking steady returns.
The debt funds category primarily invest in government bonds, securities and treasury bills, providing low-risk and stable growth opportunities.
The feature of instant redemption allows investors to withdraw funds directly into their bank account within seconds, unlike regular redemptions that take one or two business days.
Currently, investors can instantly redeem up to 90 per cent of their invested amount, capped at ₹50,000 per day.
Through the new partnership, Curie Money has integrated ICICI Prudential AMC’s liquid fund with instant redemption and UPI functionality, creating a seamless experience for users.
Investors can now steadily grow their money in ICICI Prudential’s Liquid Fund and instantly use it for UPI payments.
The collaboration between Curie Money and ICICI Prudential AMC, which bridges the gap between savings and spending in real time, marks a significant step forward in digital money management landscape.
