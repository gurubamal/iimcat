--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuesday’s one-hour Muhurat trading session -- a time-honoured ritual symbolising auspicious beginnings for investors -- saw a strong start but ended largely flat as early gains fizzled out.
The Sensex had jumped over 270 points at the open, while the Nifty briefly crossed the 25,900 mark, led by buying in largecap stocks such as Infosys, HDFC Bank, and Mahindra & Mahindra. However, profit-taking toward the close trimmed most of the gains, leaving both indices marginally higher for the day.
Still, the mood remained optimistic, with investors participating enthusiastically in the symbolic trades to usher in good fortune for the new Samvat year. The brief session, held between 1:45 pm and 2:45 pm, saw light volumes but healthy activity across large financials, auto majors, and energy stocks.
Significance of Diwali Balipratipada
Diwali Balipratipada, also known as Govardhan Puja or Padwa, is celebrated a day after Diwali to honour King Bali, whose devotion and righteousness earned him a special blessing from Lord Vishnu.
According to legend, Vishnu, in his Vamana avatar, granted Bali permission to visit his kingdom and people once a year — a day marked as Balipratipada. The festival symbolises the triumph of good governance, humility, and devotion over arrogance and greed. It also signifies renewal and prosperity, marking the beginning of a new financial and social cycle, making it deeply auspicious for traders and investors.
Samvat 2082 outlook
Market experts said the positive opening to Samvat 2082 reflects expectations of a profit-led revival after a muted year for equities.
"Despite a robust pre-Diwali rally, Samvat 2081 was a year of consolidation. The market’s underperformance was driven by a sharp slowdown in earnings growth to around 5%," said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.
"The trend going forward will depend on how corporate profits recover. If earnings grow 8–10% in FY26 and accelerate to 15% in FY27, markets could rally strongly in Samvat 2082."
The sentiment is broadly shared across brokerages. Amisha Vora, Chairperson and Managing Director at PL Capital, said optimism is gradually returning.
"India lagged global peers despite strong domestic fundamentals last year. But with earnings downgrades largely behind us, the setup for an earnings-led recovery is now in place. GDP growth of around 6.8% and easing liquidity create a favourable environment for Indian equities," she said.
The market session on Thursday will see a return to normal volumes as investors digest fresh corporate earnings and global cues. The focus will now shift to Q2 results, particularly from financials, energy, and IT companies.
While global headwinds such as US–China trade tensions and crude price swings remain, the consensus among market watchers is that India enters Samvat 2082 with better valuation comfort, fiscal stability, and structural momentum
