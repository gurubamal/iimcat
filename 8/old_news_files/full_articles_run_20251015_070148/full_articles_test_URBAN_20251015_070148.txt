Nuvama said that between 15 October 2025 and 30 January 2026, lock-in periods for 85 companies are set to end, unlocking shares worth nearly $28 billion. “It’s important to note that not all of these shares will come for sale as a sizable portion is held by Promoters & Group,” the brokerage said. Among those with lock-ins ending this week are the three September-listed names: Shringar House of Mangalsutra, Dev Accelerator, and Urban Company.
Shringar House of Mangalsutra
The jewellery retailer, listed on 17 September 2025, had issued shares at Rs 165 apiece. It debuted at a 14% premium, opening at Rs 188.5 and later hitting an all-time high of Rs 213.35. As of 14 October, the stock traded around Rs 199, up 20.6% from its issue price, valuing the company at about Rs 1,919 crore.
According to Nuvama’s lock-in analysis, about 4 million shares, or 4% of total outstanding equity, will be eligible for trading starting 15 October.
Dev Accelerator
Dev Accelerator, which provides flexible workspace and managed office solutions, was also listed on 17 September 2025 at Rs 61 per share. Despite strong subscription interest, with the IPO oversubscribed 64 times, the stock has since fallen to Rs 48.04 as of 14 October, a 21% decline from its issue price.
Nuvama estimates around 5 million shares, or 6% of total equity, will become available for trading starting 15 October.
Urban Company
Urban Company, the tech-enabled home and beauty services platform, will see its anchor lock-in period end on 16 October. Listed on 17 September 2025, the stock had a blockbuster debut, opening at Rs 162.25, a 57.5% premium to its Rs 103 issue price.
As of 15 October, shares trade at Rs 152.20, about 48% higher than the issue price, giving the company a market capitalisation of Rs 21,922 crore. Nuvama’s data shows 41 million shares, or 3% of total outstanding stock, will be released from lock-in.
More lock-in expiries ahead
According to Nuvama’s broader analysis, several other companies will also see their one-month or three-month share lock-ins end later in October. These include Euro Pratik Sales, GK Energy, Saatvik Green Energy, Atlanta Electricals, and Seshaasai Technologies, among others.
For investors, these expiries offer a window into early post-IPO performance trends, a period when price discovery and institutional positioning often shape the stock’s medium-term trajectory.
