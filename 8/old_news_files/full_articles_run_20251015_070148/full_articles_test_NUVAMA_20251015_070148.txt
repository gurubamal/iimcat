--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Samvat 2082, earnings visibility remains strong, supported by healthy credit growth, a manufacturing rebound, and infrastructure spending, driving broad-based profitability. Market valuations are reasonable at around 19–20 times one-year forward Nifty earnings, though mid and small caps may consolidate after recent gains. Liquidity and sentiment are expected to remain positive, backed by domestic savings, government spending, and a resilient banking system. While short-term volatility from geopolitical events and commodity swings is possible, India’s domestic growth, policy stability, and earnings strength support a constructive medium-term outlook. Here are 5 stocks that Nuvama thinks can give meaningful returns this Diwali.

2/6
Bank of India
The chart has changed its stance from “sell on rise” to “buy on dip” following a breakout in 2023. For the first time in the past 15 years, the stock has recorded a sustained higher bottom three times—in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Technical indicators, including Fibonacci extensions, suggest renewed strength, with the stock poised to reach 100% of the extension target.

3/6
BEML
The counter delivered an 18-year breakout in 2023 and has since gained momentum, consistently forming higher lows on weekly and monthly charts. A potential Cup and Handle pattern is also developing on the weekly charts. Additionally, the ratio chart of BEML versus Nifty indicates that the current upward trend is likely to continue delivering returns in Samvat 2082.

Can Fin Homes
The stock has been trading within an upward rising channel since 2018 and has delivered 100% returns from its lows near the lower end of the channel in the past two instances. Currently, in the third instance, the charts suggest a similar upside potential from the bottom made in February 2025 around Rs 560.

5/6
Graphite India
The stock has broken out of a bullish (inverted) head and shoulders pattern on the weekly charts, with targets suggesting a test of the upward-sloping resistance around Rs 650. The interlocking setup indicates that a sustained breakout above Rs 650 could trigger a multi-year Cup and Handle formation, potentially pushing prices into higher triple digits.

6/6
Vedanta
The share has delivered a high 15-year Cup and Handle breakout on the monthly charts. Such breakouts typically end multi-year consolidation phases and propel the stock higher, offering potential multi-fold returns over the coming quarters or years. The stock has also formed higher lows on monthly charts over the past 4–5 years, reflecting steady demand at lower levels. With prices near all-time highs, momentum is likely to accelerate further.
