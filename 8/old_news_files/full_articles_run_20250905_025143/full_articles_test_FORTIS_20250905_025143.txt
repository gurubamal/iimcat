Morgan Stanley expects Apple to modestly increase iPhone 17 prices at its Sept. 9 event, the first hike since 2017. The iPhone 17 Air will debut with a thinner design, C1 modem, and $100 premium over the iPhone 16 Plus, while the Pro will start at $1,099 for 256GB as lower-storage options are dropped.
