Sarveshwar Foods, a leading producer of organic and basmati rice, has entered into a strategic memorandum of understanding (MoU) with a German technology company to bring in next-generation solutions for rice storage and preservation.
The MoU comes as the company continues to expand its capacity and presence across domestic and international markets, fuelling its journey to become a global leader in value-added food products.
The company will adopt CO₂-based storage system to preserve rice freshness without chemical preservatives and use reusable cocoons for storage for reducing contamination and waste.
Catering to the international demand, the company will adopt smoke generator technology to create a premium smoky flavour.
It targets global expansion by enhancing product differentiation in Europe, West Asia and North America.
The new technology will strengthen Sarveshwar’s premium product portfolio while aligning with its long-term strategy of innovation, sustainability and global competitiveness, said the company.
By blending traditional expertise with advanced solutions, the company aims to accelerate export growth, build deeper consumer trust and capture new market opportunities.
Rohit Gupta, Chairman, Sarveshwar Foods, said as the company expands its presence and capacity, the technologies will play a pivotal role in enhancing quality, boosting efficiency and delivering unique product experiences to consumers worldwide.
“With a legacy of over 130 years, the flagship brands Sarveshwar and Nimbark have consistently delivered authentic and healthy food products across India and international markets. Along with scaling organic farming base, strengthening farmer network and diversifying into premium FMCG categories, the initiative further fuels the company’s growth journey,” he said.
