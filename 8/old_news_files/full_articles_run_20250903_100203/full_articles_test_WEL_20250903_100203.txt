Krystal Integrated Services Limited (KISL) has secured a five-year contract worth ₹370 crore from the Commissionerate of Social Welfare, Pune, to provide mechanised housekeeping and outsourced manpower services across welfare institutions in Maharashtra.
The contract covers a vast network of facilities, including over 2,800 hostels for boys and girls, 93 residential schools, 19 Scheduled Ashram Schools, 6 Industrial Training Institutes, 34 Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Nyay Bhavans and 54 old age homes. The engagement also extends to cooperative societies, spinning mills and a residential school in Pune for children of sweepers.
The Commissionerate of Social Welfare operates one of India’s most extensive welfare ecosystems, serving thousands of students, senior citizens and vulnerable communities across the State. The contract represents one of the most significant socially impactful engagements in Krystal’s government portfolio.
“This contract allows us to serve the backbone of Maharashtra’s social welfare system,” said Sanjay Dighe, CEO and Whole Time Director of KISL. “We believe facility management is about enabling growth and empowerment.”
Mumbai-headquartered KISL, established in 2000, provides integrated facility management services across healthcare, education, government administration, transportation infrastructure and retail sectors. The company expanded its operations from 1,962 to 3,209 locations between FY21 and FY25, with its customer base growing from 262 to 461 clients.
The shares of Krystal Integrated Services Limited (KISL) were trading on the NSE at ₹700 up by ₹2.85 or 0.41 per cent at 3.05 pm.

Welcure Drugs & Pharmaceuticals has executed a Letter of Intent with Singapore-based Telexcell Trade Pte to facilitate strategic investment. Telexcell Trade will buy 25 per cent equity stake in Welcure Drugs at an indicative price of ₹20 per share.
The proposed all-cash investment is subject to due diligence, execution of definitive agreements and requisite corporate, shareholder and regulatory approvals, including those from SEBI, RBI and stock exchanges.
Both parties expect to complete the due diligence and documentation process within 90 days. This strategic investment is aimed at enhancing Welcure’s global footprint, leveraging growing opportunities in emerging markets.
Previously, the BSE-listed company announced plans to invest around ₹70–80 crore in establishing a modern cGMP-standard agro pharma research laboratory. The company also proposes to raise up to ₹80 crore via Qualified Institutional Placement to support this initiative and general corporate purposes.
