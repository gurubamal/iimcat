New Delhi, Sept 3
Amidst heightened competition in the beauty and personal care space, Honasa Consumer said it is adopting a “focused approach” with an ambition to reach ₹5,000 crore in terms of annual recurring revenues in the coming years. The company believes its flagship brand, Mamaearth, has the potential to scale up to ₹2,000 crore in revenues.
In a letter to shareholders in the Annual Report FY25, the founders of the company, Ghazal Alagh and Varun Alagh, expressed confidence that “by the end of the decade, Mamaearth, which has been the fastest brand to achieve ₹1,000 crore in revenue, will also be the fastest to hit ₹2,000 crore in the top line, with almost 60 per cent contribution coming from offline channels. We will have one more ₹1,000-crore brand in The Derma Co, and we will have at least two more ₹500-crore brands in our portfolio. We will become the fastest FMCG company to reach ₹5,000 crore ARR.”
In FY25, The Derma Co crossed the ₹500-crore revenue mark, while BBlunt’s net sales stood at ₹100 crore. Meanwhile, the company’s brands Aqualogica and Dr Sheth’s achieved a net annual revenue run-rate of over ₹180 crore and ₹150 crore respectively.
“At different times, we see consumers adopting diverse consumption cycles when it comes to product propositions. Active and dermatological brands are far more popular in the online space, while offline consumption continues to prefer ‘naturals’ brands. Hence, our North star metric, as we move forward, will be category-level growth rather than brand-level growth,” the founders stated.
Identifying face cleanser, shampoos, moisturisers, sunscreens, serums, lipsticks and baby-care as its “focus categories”, the company said, “We will plan on delivering strong competitive growth in our focus categories by growing different brands in those categories, depending on the kind of consumer trends we see.”
