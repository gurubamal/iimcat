Mark Carney said Canada and the US are in negotiations to resolve issues in tariff-hit sectors after a “very constructive” conversation with President Donald Trump on Monday evening.
The Canadian prime minister said more meetings are taking place in Washington involving officials including Michael Sabia, Canada’s top civil servant.
“We are expecting agreements in some of the strategic sectors,” Carney told reporters Wednesday in Toronto, referring to industries that have been targeted by US tariffs such as autos, steel and aluminum.
But he also cautioned that a deal might not happen quickly. “Don’t expect immediate white smoke on one of these strategic sectors, but that’s the type of conversation that we’re having.”
Carney’s Monday call with Trump was not previously known, as neither his office nor the White House issued a readout afterward.
Trump raised some tariffs on Canada to 35% from 25% on Aug. 1, but he kept in place an exception for a broad range of products that are traded under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Carney defended his country’s competitive position, arguing that the exemption gives Canada a blended tariff rate of about 5.5%, “the lowest average tariff of any country in the world.”
Many of Trump’s tariffs are under a legal cloud after a US court declared them illegal on Aug. 29. But they’re still in place and the administration is attempting to get the US Supreme Court to back his tariff powers.
Carney also said the government is looking for ways to resolve trade frictions with Canada’s second-largest trading partner, China, which imposed punishing tariffs on food items such as canola and pork after Canada placed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.

Title   : Trump Plans to Block Iberdrola Massachusetts Wind Projects

The Trump administration is moving to block the development of more offshore wind projects, the latest in a series of high-profile setbacks for an industry that’s caught the president’s ire.
The US is working to withdraw a permit for the New England Wind 1 and 2 offshore wind projects in Massachusetts, according to a court filing dated Wednesday. So far, stop-work orders and yanked permits — as well as the threats of them — have disrupted plans for at least four wind farms off the US East Coast this year.
The Trump administration’s move to block the venture comes amid an unprecedented attack on the nascent offshore wind industry that is imperiling projects and their investors. The offshore wind industry is unusually exposed to political risk, with projects planned in federal waters controlled by the president and his executive branch.
Iberdrola SA’s subsidiary Avangrid Inc. is developing New England Wind 1 and 2, a project southwest of Nantucket, Massachusetts, that aims supply enough electricity to meet the needs of more than 900,000 homes in the state, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said.
Shares of Iberdrola fell as much as 1.7%. Other developers also declined. Orsted A/S dropped as much as 2.6%, and Vestas Wind Systems A/S slipped as much as 1.3%.
Iberdrola declined to comment on the move.
Many offshore wind farm developers had moved forward with projects after receiving permits under former President Joe Biden, despite being squeezed for years with high interest rates and supply chain issues. Trump’s special contempt for offshore wind, however, has imperiled those investments, with projects that are even 80% finished being forced to halt construction.
Turbine construction near Nantucket gained national attention last summer after a blade from an abutting wind farm splintered and sent shards of glass and foam across the island’s much-lauded southern beaches. The island community ultimately settled with blade manufacturer GE Vernova Inc. a year later, securing $10.5 million to compensate local businesses for cleanup costs, forgone rental income and other losses.

The administration has also halted construction of a near-complete project south of Rhode Island led by Orsted SA. In April, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum froze Equinor ASA’s $5 billion Empire Wind farm off the coast of Long Island, later lifting the order after striking a deal with Governor Kathy Hochul to allow a new natural gas pipeline.
