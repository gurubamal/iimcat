--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Nifty50 gained over 1% in the week ended September 5, closing firmly above the 100-day EMA, a key technical support. Broader markets also extended their momentum, with the Midcap and Smallcap indices advancing 2–3%, underlining continued strong participation beyond frontline stocks.
Foreign investors, however, remained cautious. FIIs continued to be net cash sellers, offloading equities worth ₹4,361.99 crore between September 1 and September 4, 2025.
Volatility played out as expected
In last week’s note, we highlighted September 5 as a potential turning point — and the market did not disappoint. Nifty was highly volatile, witnessing a sharp 150-point fall within just 15 minutes around 10:00 AM. Such moves highlight why traders must stay cautious on time-sensitive dates.Interestingly, our specific intraday marker of 12:25 PM on September 5 also proved accurate, with the day’s low being formed around this time. This further validates the precision of time-based analysis in navigating market volatility.
