As part of the preparations, Reliance has demerged its fast-moving consumer goods unit, Reliance Consumer Products, which will now be a direct subsidiary of the parent company. The retailer is also streamlining operations by shutting down underperforming outlets to improve margins ahead of its market debut, the report added.
The IPO is expected to provide exits for investors such as Singapore’s GIC, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Qatar Investment Authority, KKR, TPG, and Silver Lake.

Reliance Retail will retain formats, including Reliance Smart, Freshpik, Reliance Digital, JioMart, Reliance Trends, 7-Eleven, and Reliance Jewels. Sources also indicated there could be a consolidation of formats, though discussions remain preliminary.
For Jio, Ambani is aiming for a listing in the first half of 2026. He noted at the company’s latest AGM that Jio has the potential to create value on par with its global counterparts.
With Reliance Jio’s much-anticipated IPO—which could value the company as high as Rs 13.5 lakh crore—India is preparing for what may be its largest listing in history.
Global brokerage Goldman Sachs has projected Reliance Jio’s enterprise value at $154 billion in a bull-case scenario, setting an upper benchmark for what analysts call a potential game-changer for Indian capital markets. Other major brokerages are similarly bullish: Jefferies values Jio at $146 billion, Macquarie at $123 billion, and Emkay at $121 billion.

Analysts estimate the listing could value Jio between $134 billion and $146 billion (Rs 11.2–12.19 lakh crore), placing it among India’s top five listed companies by market capitalisation.
At around 2:30 pm, Reliance Industries’ share price was quoting at Rs 1,405.5, up 0.44% from the previous close on the NSE. The stock has gained 13% over the past six months.

Title   : Anil Ambani group stocks Reliance Power, Reliance Infra rally 5%. Here’s what’s unfolding 
Source  : economictimes.indiatimes.com

URL     : https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/anil-ambani-group-stocks-reliance-power-reliance-infra-rally-5-heres-whats-unfolding/articleshow/123917974.cms
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The gains come after both stocks shed nearly 30% over the past three months, erasing much of the optimism that greeted Ambani’s corporate comeback earlier this year. Over the past year, Reliance Power has remained higher by 52% and Reliance Infra by 20%, but that is a sharp comedown from May peaks, when the two had rallied 173% and 141% respectively over 12 months.
Technical signals mixed
From a technical standpoint, Reliance Infra remains under pressure. The stock trades below seven of its eight key simple moving averages, including the 10-day and 200-day, with its Relative Strength Index at 34, just above oversold levels. Its Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) stands at -14, a strong bearish signal.
Reliance Power’s chart looks somewhat firmer, trading above five of its eight SMAs, including the 200-day, though its RSI at 42.9 and MACD at -1.3 also reflect bearish undertones.
Legal shadows deepen
The bounce came despite mounting legal risks for Ambani. The Enforcement Directorate has filed a fresh case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act against him, Reliance Communications and others, alleging they defrauded the State Bank of India of more than Rs 2,900 crore. The case stems from a Central Bureau of Investigation complaint in August that triggered raids at Ambani’s residence and Reliance Communications’ offices.
Ambani has “strongly denied all allegations and charges,” saying he has been “selectively singled out” over matters dating back more than a decade, when he served as a non-executive director at Reliance Communications. Adding to the cloud, Bank of Baroda this month classified Reliance Communications’ loans as “fraud,” following similar moves by SBI and Bank of India.
Earnings offer little relief
Both companies returned to profitability in the June quarter. Reliance Power reported a Rs 44.68 crore profit, reversing a Rs 97.85 crore loss a year earlier, though revenue declined 5.3% to Rs 1,885.58 crore. Reliance Infra earned Rs 59.84 crore versus a Rs 233.74 crore loss last year, but sales slid nearly 18% to Rs 5,907.82 crore.
“Reliance Infrastructure has corrected sharply but showed signs of repair in Q1 FY26,” said Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS, pointing to tighter costs and arbitration progress. “While unrelated to R-Infra’s operations, this headline risk can weigh on multiples.”
Recent wins in energy
Reliance Power last week announced it had secured a 500 MW/1000 MWh Battery Energy Storage System contract from the Solar Energy Corporation of India, marking its entry into renewable storage. The project, to be delivered at SECI’s Fatehgarh substation in Rajasthan, is slated for commissioning within 24 months.
Separately, Reliance Infra in mid-August bagged a 390 MW solar power plus 780 MWh battery storage project from NHPC, underscoring its tilt toward clean energy.
Outlook
Dasani said Reliance Infra’s performance over the next two quarters hinges on execution in EPC projects, arbitration cash inflows and cost controls. Reliance Power’s trajectory, he added, depends on stable operations at its Sasan and Rosa plants and timely discom payments.
Still, analysts caution that any operational progress could be eclipsed by investigations linked to Ambani. For investors, the question remains whether the fragile rebound can withstand intensifying legal scrutiny, or whether it marks another fleeting uptick in the long-stalled turnaround of Ambani’s debt-laden empire.

Title   : Insurers not to get ITC benefit towards GST paid on commission on individual health, life policies

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Insurance companies will not get Input Tax Credit on commission or brokerages for individual health and life insurance policies, Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Custom (CBIC) said on Tuesday. It has also said that hotels with room tariff of less than ₹7,500 will not get ITC.
At present, insurers are availing ITC on many inputs and input services such as commissions, brokerage and reinsurance. “Out of these input services, reinsurance services will be exempted. Input Tax Credit of other inputs or input services is to be reversed because the output services will be exempted,” CBIC said in a set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). GST Council, in its meeting on September 3, recommended exempting individual life and health insurance along with family floater.
The board said services of individual health and life insurance business provided by insurers to the insured, where the insured is not a group, are included within the ambit of the exemption. When these services are provided to an individual or to an individual with his/her family, the same will be exempted, it said.
Mandatory rate
For hotels, the board said that suppliers of hotel accommodation service where the value of a unit of accommodation is less than or equal to ₹7,500 per unit per day, will have to charge GST at 5 per cent without ITC. “It is a mandatory rate prescribed for such services, and the option to pay GST at the rate of 18 per cent with ITC is not available for such units,” the board said.
When asked how a service provider should deal with ITC in cases where GST is payable at a rate of 5 per cent without ITC, the board said that credit of input tax charged on goods or services used exclusively in supplying such services shall not be taken by the service provider. Also credit of input tax charged on goods or services used partly for supplying such services and partly for supplying other taxable supplies shall be reversed by the service provider as if the supply leviable to 5 per cent without ITC is an exempt supply. Consequently, proportionate ITC shall be required to be reversed by the service provider, it said.
Another question was about liability to pay GST for local services provided by e commerce operators (ECO). According to the board, services by way of local delivery provided through an ECO where the person supplying such services is not liable to register then the liability to pay GST will be on the ECO. The services of local delivery are taxable at 18 per cent.
Renting service
On the issue of tax treatment for leasing or renting services without operator, the board said that majority of leasing or rental services without operator are taxed at the same rate of taxes applicable on supply of like goods. No change is proposed in this regard. The tax rate on such services will continue to be equal to the tax rate applicable on supply of like goods. For example, if cars or machines are taxed at 18 per cent then the rate of 18 per cent will be applicable for leasing or renting (without operator) of such cars or machines
