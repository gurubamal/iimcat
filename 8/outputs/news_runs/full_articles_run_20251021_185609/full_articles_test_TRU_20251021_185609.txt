New Delhi [India], : South Korea's top conglomerate leaders joined U.S. President Donald Trump for a round of golf in Florida, in what observers view as an effort to strengthen economic and diplomatic ties between the two countries, as reported by the Pulse, the English service of Maeil Business Newspaper Korea.
The business leaders met Trump and other global executives at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach on Saturday, local time. It was the first known instance of a sitting U.S. president playing golf with Korean business leaders.
The participants reportedly included Samsung Electronics Co. Executive Chairman Jay Y. Lee, SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won, Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Euisun Chung, LG Group Chairman Koo Kwang-mo, and Hanwha Group Vice Chairman Kim Dong-kwan.
SoftBank Group Chairman Masayoshi Son is said to have organized the meeting.
According to the White House press pool, Trump arrived at the course at 9:15 a.m. and left around 4:50 p.m., spending roughly seven hours at the venue. It was his 11th round there since returning to office.
The Korean executives reportedly traveled together in an airport limousine bus rather than private vehicles. A black bus believed to be carrying them left the course shortly after Trump's departure and was seen heading to a five-star hotel on Palm Beach Island, where Son was later spotted in the lobby along with aides accompanying the Korean delegation.
It remains unclear who played in Trump's group.
The event was believed to have followed a shotgun start format, in which players begin simultaneously on different holes.
While few details have been confirmed, the gathering was reportedly more than a social occasion. People familiar with the matter said discussions may have touched on investment and trade issues in North America.
The meeting took place as Seoul and Washington are in the final stage of trade negotiations. It also comes as Korean conglomerates expand large-scale U.S. investments in sectors including semiconductors, batteries, automobiles, and energy.
"It's likely that President Trump held in-depth discussions with the heads of major Korean companies," said an industry source. "Given that all the country's top business leaders were present, the meeting probably went beyond a simple round of golf."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tata Group's philanthropy arm, Tata Trusts, has unanimously re-appointed Venu Srinivasan as a trustee for life amid reports of internal conflict among the divisions within the organisation, news agency PTI reported on Tuesday, 21 October 2025.
Venu Srinivasan's re-appointment comes right ahead of his tenure expiry date on 23 October 2025, at a time when the people within Tata Trusts are vertically split. One group aligns with Noel Tata, who took over the reins after Ratan Tata's demise, and the other with Mehli Mistry, who has ties with the extended Shapoorji Pallonji family.
People aware of the development told the agency that Srinivasan's re-appointment was unanimous. However, Tata Trust refused to respond to the news agency's queries.
Renewal and fresh appointment is required to be unanimous as per past practice - a person aware of the development said.
With Venu Srinivasan's re-appointment, the focus now shifts to the re-appointment of Mehli Mistry as a trustee, whose term expires on 28 October 2025.
Mistry's re-appointment and continuation as a trustee will require the unanimous approval of the trustees for the lifetime tenure appointment, according to the report.
“Renewal and fresh appointment is required to be unanimous as per past practice. Renewal, after which it will be for life, requires unanimous approval,” a person aware of the development told the news agency.
They also said that the re-appointment is automatic and applies to all trustees.
Tata Trusts oversees several charitable trusts, including the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Sir Ratan Tata Trust. The entity also holds a 66% stake in Tata Sons, the main holding company, which owns stakes in all Tata Group firms.
According to the report, the original meeting held on 17 October 2024 resolved that if the tenure of a trustee expires, they are to be re-appointed by the trust concerned without any limit attached to the period of validity.
The report also said that if any trustee chooses to vote against this motion, they would be in breach of the commitment and would not be fit to serve at ‘Tata Trusts by such conduct’.
The Shapoorji Pallonji family owns more than 18% stake in Tata Sons, the holding company for all Tata Group companies.

Title   : Trump Official Warns China Against Penalizing Companies Investing in US

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Trump administration warned China not to retaliate against foreign companies helping the US to develop critical industries, after Beijing last week sanctioned the US units of a South Korean shipping giant over its plans to invest in the American maritime sector.
“China’s recent retaliatory actions against private companies across the globe is part of a broader pattern of economic coercion to influence American politics and control global supply chains by discouraging foreign companies from investing in America’s shipbuilding and other critical industries,” US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said in a statement Monday.
Greer’s warning is the latest step in a long-standing series of maritime disputes between the US and China, which accounts for more than half of the world’s shipbuilding and has sought in recent years to increase its control of the critical South China Sea. The battle has implications for the global economy, as vessels are responsible for moving more than 80% of international trade.
While the US maintains the world’s most powerful navy, it has comparatively minimal shipbuilding capabilities. As such, the Trump administration has sought to bolster US shipbuilding by inviting investment from South Korea, the world’s second-largest shipbuilder.
The sanctions China announced last week hit at that effort directly — prohibiting people or organizations in China from transacting with US units of South Korea’s Hanwha Ocean Co., while threatening further retaliatory measures on the industry.
“Attempts at intimidation will not stop the United States from rebuilding its shipbuilding base and responding appropriately to China’s targeting of critical industrial sectors for dominance,” Greer said.
It’s far from the only example. Both sides have slapped special port fees on each other’s commercial vessels, which took effect last week. The US is also set to levy a 100% tariff on Chinese imports of essential port equipment and floated a 150% import tax on other cargo handling equipment. Trump has sought to minimize Chinese companies’ control of critical global ports, including around the Panama Canal.
Shipping is one of several points of contention in the China-US relationship that has kept global investors on edge in recent days. Beijing has tightened export controls on rare earths among other measures, while the US has expanded curbs on China’s access to chips and threatened the country with additional 100% tariffs.
Earlier Monday, President Donald Trump said he anticipated discussing China’s territorial ambitions regarding the self-governing island of Taiwan when he meets with his counterpart, Xi Jinping, next week at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea. The president sidestepped questions about whether he expected China to link trade concessions in exchange for Taiwan-related asks.

Title   : Tata Trusts reappoints Venu Srinivasan for life; focus now on Mehli Mistry’s renewal amid internal rift

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tata Trusts has unanimously reappointed Venu Srinivasan as a trustee for life, and all eyes are now on the upcoming decision regarding Mehli Mistry’s renewal, amid reported internal divisions within the organisation.
The reappointment of Srinivasan this week, ahead of his term expiring on October 23, comes amid reports of a vertical split within Tata Trusts - with one faction said to align with Noel Tata, who took over as chairman following Ratan Tata’s death, and the other comprising those seen as loyalists of the former doyen.
A source with direct knowledge of the matter said reappointment of Srinivasan, chairman emeritus of TVS Group, was unanimous.
Tata Trusts declined to comment on the news.
Focus shifts to Mehli Mistry’s renewal
The focus now shifts to the reappointment of Mistry, whose term ends on October 28, with opinions divided on whether his continuation is automatic or requires unanimous approval from the trustees for a lifetime tenure.
Tata Trusts, the umbrella body overseeing several charitable trusts including the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Sir Ratan Tata Trust, holds a 66 per cent stake in Tata Sons - the holding company of the 156-year-old Tata Group, which comprises around 400 companies, including 30 listed entities.
“Renewal and fresh appointment is required to be unanimous as per past practice. Renewal, after which it will be for life, requires unanimous approval,” said a source.
October 17 resolution sparks debate
However, another person said, “The reappointment is automatic and it is applicable to all the trustees.” Citing minutes of the joint meeting of the trustees of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Sir Ratan Tata Trust held on October 17, 2024, the person said it was resolved that on the expiry of tenure of any trustee, the trustee would be reappointed by the concerned trust without any limit being attached to the period of tenure.
As per the resolution, any trustee who chose to vote otherwise would be in “breach of their commitment and is not fit and proper to serve on Tata Trusts by such conduct”, the person added.
Moreover, the person said if there is any breach of the commitment by a Trustee, it will necessitate the reopening of all resolutions passed by Tata Trusts, “including the appointment of Noel Tata as a director on the Board of Tata Sons, which formed part of the October 17, 2024 Trustees’ resolution”.
Also, according to the October 17, 2024 resolution, all trustees are appointed on a long-term and life basis and trusteeship would be revisited upon reaching 75 years of age.

Title   : Trump makes rare earths deal with Australia to fight China
Source  : www.thehindubusinessline.com

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
US President Donald Trump has signed a landmark pact with visiting Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to boost America’s access to rare earths and other critical minerals, an effort to counter China’s tight grip on the supply chains of key metals.
The two governments will jointly invest in a swathe of mines and processing projects in Australia to boost production of commodities used in advanced technologies from electric vehicles to semiconductors and fighter planes. Australia has an $8.5 billion “pipeline that we have ready to go,” Albanese said at a meeting between the two leaders at the White House.
“In about a year from now, we’ll have so much critical mineral and rare earths that you won’t know what to do with them,” Trump said.
The US has been locked in a rare-earths tussle with China since Beijing fought back against Trump’s trade offensive earlier this year, imposing export curbs on the materials. It has since expanded those restrictions. The prospect of even tighter supply has injected momentum into an American push to build alternative production capacity, even as industry executives and analysts caution that replacing a vast network of mines and refining plants will not be swift.
The leaders said the agreement would include Australian processing of rare earths and other critical minerals, with Albanese adding that Australia had “capacity” to expand those efforts. The US and Australia pledged to protect their domestic markets from “unfair trade practices,” including through adopting trading standards that involve “price floors or similar measures,” according to the text of the deal circulated by Albanese’s office.
“This is the most significant bilateral minerals cooperation we have seen between two major Western countries,” Gracelin Baskaran, a critical minerals-focused director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said by phone. “Today’s announcement really shows the US isn’t trying to address critical minerals alone. It’s looking to find the right partners.”
The deal, which prompted a surge in Australian rare earths and critical minerals stocks on Tuesday, will begin with the US and Australia each paying more than $1 billion over the next six months for initial projects, with some further projects in both countries, the Australian prime minister said. The document did not include details on which entities would provide that financing.
Rare earths are a subset of critical minerals, a wider group of core materials which in the US includes dozens of metals. Even before the recent export controls, China had already put restrictions on supplies of vital inputs including gallium, germanium and antimony.
The Pentagon will help fund the construction of the planned 100 tonne-a-year Alcoa-Sojitz gallium refinery in Western Australia as part of the deal, according to the White House. The Export-Import Bank of the United States is also issuing letters of interest for more than $2.2 billion in financing on critical mineral projects.
The sit-down, Albanese’s first White House visit since Trump returned to power, comes as the Australian leader looks to shore up ties with the US, using his nation’s mineral wealth as leverage. China’s rare-earth export restrictions have rattled economies across the globe, with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying last week that allies — including Australia — are in talks about a united response.
Australia, which holds the world’s fourth-largest deposits of rare earths, has long sought to position itself as a viable alternative to China for supplies crucial for industries covering semiconductors, defence technology, renewable energy and other sectors. The country is also the base of the only producer of so-called heavy rare earths outside China, through Lynas Rare Earths Ltd.
Efforts to secure a deal were already underway ahead of Albanese’s visit. More than a dozen Australian mining firms held meetings last month in Washington with officials from various agencies and were told the US was looking for ways to obtain equity-like stakes in companies, according to people familiar with the talks, part of a broader American strategy to develop supply chains to compete with China.
Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers met with US investors from firms including Blackstone Inc. and Blue Owl Capital in New York last week to pitch his country as a stable, resource-rich destination for global capital and a key partner in efforts to diversify critical supply chains.
There has been growing confidence that Australia and the US would begin discussions on how Canberra could provide secure rare earth shipments and bolster US capabilities. That belief has sparked investor enthusiasm, sending shares of miners such as Lynas up by over 150 per cent during the past 12 months.
Submarine sales
Trump on Monday said the two leaders were discussing “trade, submarines, lots of other military equipment,” with national security matters high on the agenda. The US president has pressed Canberra to increase defence spending to 3.5 per cent of gross domestic product from around 2 per cent now, a move Australia has so far resisted.
Australia agreed to purchase $1.2 billion in underwater drones and take delivery of a first tranche of Apache helicopters in a separate $2.6 billion deal, the White House said.
Another key issue is an arrangement for the US under the Aukus pact to sell Australia as many as five nuclear-powered Virginia-class submarines by the early 2030s. Australia and the UK would then design and build a next-generation submarine partly using American technology, due to be completed in the 2040s.
The Aukus agreement was signed by former US President Joe Biden’s team in 2021 to counter Chinese military expansion in the Indo-Pacific region. The submarine deal is central to the nations’ collective security agreement. The Trump administration, however, is reviewing the pact to determine if it is “aligned with the President’s America First agenda,” according to the Pentagon, raising fears that Trump could abandon it.
Officials from Australia and the UK, though, have downplayed that prospect. And Trump on Monday suggested that he planned to push forward with submarine sales.
“We are doing that,” Trump said in response to a question about expediting the sales. “We have the best submarines in the world, anywhere in the world, and we’re building a few more, currently under construction. And now we’re starting, we have it all set with Anthony.”
The US president also praised military cooperation between the two allies.
Still, Trump suggested he was unlikely to offer Australia tariff relief, which Canberra has sought as a nation that runs a trade deficit with the US. Trump hit Australian goods with a 10 per cent duty, the baseline the president imposed on many other countries’ products.
“Australia pays very low tariffs — very, very low tariffs,” Trump said.
Albanese faces a balancing act on trade as he meets Trump. The Australian leader has also sought closer trade ties with China, his country’s largest trading partner. Albanese visited Beijing in July, his second visit since taking office.

Title   : Tata Trusts reappoints Venu Srinivasan as trustee; Mistry up for renewal

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Venu Srinivasan’s reappointment as lifetime trustee on Tata Trusts was unanimously approved by all the members, sources said. The upcoming reappointment of Mehli Mistry in the next few days is being keenly watched.
Multiple sources said that in light of the friction amongst the trustees that has Chairman Noel Tata and Mistry in opposing camps, the reappointment of the latter may not be smooth.
A resolution passed by Tata Trusts in October 2024 stated that when the term of a trustee comes up for renewal, that trustee would be reappointed for life, subject to it being revisited on reaching 75 years, and this was to be an automatic process. Sources aligned with Mistry said Srinivasan’s reappointment was inevitable following this resolution.
Sources close to Noel Tata, however, said that it would depend on the stance taken by him on Mistry’s reappointment.
The outcome is likely to be known in the next couple of days, they said. Mistry’s term ends on October 28.
There was no response to emails sent to Tata Trusts, Mehli Mistry, and office of Noel Tata.
Mistry is part of Tata Trusts executive committee that is responsible for its overall functioning and superintendence. Apart from Mistry, the committee also has Noel Tata, Srinivasan and Vijay Singh.
Srinivasan’s reappointment comes amidst an ongoing rift among the trustees and at the core of that is control of Tata Sons and whether it should be listed or remain privately held.
Earlier, Singh’s reappointment to Tata Sons’ board was blocked by four trustees, including Mistry, whose effort to be appointed on the board was shot down by Tata.
Tata Trusts has taken the position that Tata Sons should remain unlisted, while the Shapoorji Pallonji group is in favour of a listing as that will help it to monetise some portion of its over 18 per cent stake and reduce its liabilities.

Title   : Tata Trusts trustees differ over reappointment of Venu Srinivasan and Mehli Mistry

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
More differences have surfaced among the trustees of the Tata Trusts. This time it is over the upcoming reappointment of trustees Venu Srinivasan and Mehli Mistry, whose terms end on October 23 and 28, respectively.
Divisions among the trustees surfaced in September when four trustees—Mehli Mistry, Darius Khambatta, Jehangir H Jehangir and Pramit Jhaveri—opposed the renomination of another trustee, Vijay Singh, to the board of Tata Sons. Singh subsequently stepped down from the board of Tata Sons though he remains a trustee. Singh, Srinivasan and Noel Tata find themselves ranged against the other four named above.
A circular was sent to all trustees on Saturday about the expiry of the tenures of Srinivasan and Mistry. According to a source close to the trust, while the Mistry group believes that the reappointment is automatic as per a resolution passed in the trust board meeting a year ago, the other side insists that it is subject to voting by all trustees.
Incidentally, the said resolution passed in the board meeting on October 17 last year also stated that on reappointment, the trustee’s tenure will be permanent.
Here’s the resolution shared by a person close to the trusts: “The trustees recognised that they’re all equally responsible charged with public duty and specifically tasked by Mr. Ratan N Tata. To this end, they resolve that on the expiry of tenure of any trustee, that trustee will be reappointed by the concerned trust without any limit being attached to the period of tenure of such reappointment, and in accordance with law.”
A straight reading of the resolution would imply that Venu Srinivasan and Mehli Mistry are set to be reappointed to their existing positions. And when the reappointment happens this time, they will become permanent trustees.
But the other group, which counts Noel Tata, chairman of Tata Trusts in its midst, believes that any reappointment cannot be automatic and must be agreed upon by other trustees. This difference is likely to boil over this week even as it is understood that Mehli Mistry has already responded to the circular and pointed to last year’s resolution which does not specify voting.
While the trustees are battling it out amongst themselves, sources say they’re also wary about the squabble attracting the attention of the authorities and hence are unlikely to take recourse to the courts.
