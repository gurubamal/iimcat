Why Diwali matters for Indian markets
Diwali is one of India’s most celebrated festivals — a symbol of prosperity, renewal, and victory of light over darkness. In stock market culture, it also marks the spiritual start of a new financial year.Muhurat Trading has been a part of Indian market tradition for decades, where investors place their first trades as a gesture of good fortune. Many families and brokers light lamps and decorate trading terminals to welcome a profitable year ahead.
Upcoming stock market holidays in 2025
After the Diwali holidays, only three trading breaks remain for the year — October 22 for Bali Pratipada, November 5 (Prakash Gurpurab) and December 25 (Christmas). These closures come after an event-packed festive season that has kept both investors and traders on their toes.Market outlook: Festive cheer lifts benchmarks
The Indian market enters the Diwali week on a strong note. The Sensex gained 1,451 points (1.76%) to close at 83,952, while the Nifty 50 rose 1.68% to 25,709, marking the third straight week of gains. Buying was driven by steady domestic demand, cooling inflation, and encouraging corporate earnings.Even though early sessions saw some caution due to global trade concerns, momentum picked up as the week progressed. Foreign inflows and a stronger rupee further boosted sentiment.
Sectors leading the rally
The banking and financial sector led the rally, with the Bank Nifty hitting a new lifetime high on strong participation from both private and PSU lenders. FMCG, realty, and consumption stocks also advanced 2–4% amid festive buying trends. However, IT and metals saw mild selling on profit-booking and weak global demand cues.Midcap and smallcap stocks showed mixed performance — midcaps stayed largely flat while smallcaps slipped around 0.6%, reflecting cautious trading ahead of results.
Key triggers to watch post-Diwali
Investors will focus on Q2 FY26 earnings from major names such as HUL, SBI Life Kotak Mahindra Bank, ITC, Airtel, which could set the tone for the market in Samvat 2082.Globally, updates on US–China trade talks and inflation expectations will shape foreign investor flows and overall risk appetite.
Technical View and strategy
Analysts say Nifty has crossed a key hurdle at 25,450 and could retest its record high near 26,277 if buying continues. Immediate support lies around 25,150. Bank Nifty’s next targets are 58,500 and 60,000, with supports near 56,500.They suggest a buy-on-dips approach, focusing on large-cap sectors like banking, FMCG, and autos, which show strong earnings visibility. Traders should stay selective in smallcaps and monitor global cues closely.
