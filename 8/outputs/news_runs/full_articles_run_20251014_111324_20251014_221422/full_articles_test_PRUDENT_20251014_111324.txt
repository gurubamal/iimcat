Q2 results live: HDFC Securities Bullish on Cement Sector, Sees Demand Recovery from H2FY26E
HDFC Securities on Q2 cement sector performance: The brokerage believes cement demand will accelerate from the second half of FY26E, aided by a potential GST rate cut that could boost retail consumption, following subdued offtake in FY25. Cement prices are expected to remain stable quarter-on-quarter in Q3, while margins are likely to rise in Q4FY26 as utilization increases.
Fuel costs are anticipated to stay low, and combined with a rising share of low-cost green energy and ongoing logistics improvements, this could further support margin recovery in FY26–28E. HDFC Securities has introduced FY28E estimates in its report, projecting average net sales realization (NSR) growth of 3%, 1%, and 1% in FY26, FY27, and FY28E, respectively. The brokerage notes that industry consolidation should help maintain stable to higher realizations from FY26E onward.
Unit operating expenses are expected to decline by 2% and 1% year-on-year in FY26 and FY27E, and remain flat in FY28E, driven by all-round cost efficiencies. This is projected to expand unit EBITDA by approximately INR 110/120/50 per MT in FY26/27/28E, reaching ~INR 1,200/MT by FY28E. Based on these assumptions, HDFC Securities remains positive on the sector, supporting current valuations.
