Bajaj Allianz Life launched Bajaj Allianz Life BSE 500 Enhanced Value 50 Index Fund, its latest New Fund Offer (NFO), exclusively under its Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs).
The fund is designed to provide capital appreciation through investment in equities forming part of the BSE 500 Enhanced Value 50 Index and enabling investors to have a disciplined investment approach along with life insurance protection.
Selection metrics
The fund selection framework uses three core financial ratios to identify potential undervalued opportunities. These are the Book-to-Price Ratio, Earnings-to-Price Ratio and Sales-to-Price Ratio. Together, these indicators provide a perspective of a company’s valuation, covering assets, profitability and revenue, ensuring a balanced approach that avoids dependence on any single metric.
“The Bajaj Allianz Life BSE 500 Enhanced Value 50 Index Fund offers investors a disciplined way to benefit from value investing, a strategy that has historically rewarded patience and long-term commitment. The fund provides a diversified equity exposure with a balanced risk-reward profile,’‘ Srinivas Rao Ravuri, Chief Investment Officer, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance, said in a release.
