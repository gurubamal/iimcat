Cupid has signed a term sheet to acquire a strategic stake in Saudi Arabia’s luxury fragrance brand Mansam.
The undisclosed amount of investment has been done through a fund structure managed by GII Investment Management.
The investment further strengthens Cupid’s roadmap to expand its international footprint while tapping into new, consumer-driven growth avenues.
It marks the evolution of Cupid from a healthcare-focused enterprise to a diversified global brand, aligning with emerging lifestyle and luxury consumption trends in one of the world’s fastest-growing regions.
Founded in 2022, Mansam combines authentic Arabian heritage with global sophistication. Positioned as a premium fragrance house, Mansam seeks to capture both regional and international markets with a portfolio that celebrates Arabian culture while meeting global standards of luxury.
The global fragrance industry, valued at over $60 billion, is witnessing steady growth driven by rising demand for premium and niche products.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s perfume market alone stands at $6.2 billion, of which luxury perfumes contribute over $2 billion.
Despite the dominance of luxury perfumes in the region, shelves are largely stocked with foreign labels, leaving authentic Arabian luxury perfumery as a compelling whitespace opportunity.
Mansam is strategically positioned to fill this gap by offering products that resonate with local preferences while appealing to international connoisseurs, said the company.
