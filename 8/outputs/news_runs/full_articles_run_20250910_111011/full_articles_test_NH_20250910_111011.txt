Gerrit Marx, the global chief executive of CNH Industrial, has said the 50 per cent tariffs imposed by the US on Indian products represent a pause in negotiations as both sides reassess their positions, rather than the outcome of any formal trade agreement.
“The 50 per cent that are imposed on India right now is not a result of negotiations,” Marx told reporters. “It’s a kind of a pause on a discussion where both sides, I think, are currently reassessing their options. This is not even a result. So, I think we will see in a couple of months, I hope still this year, maybe then early next year, a deal between India and the US that will be materially different from 50 per cent tariffs.”
Marx, who heads the maker of New Holland Agriculture tractors and construction equipment, said the company was currently shipping from India to the US only when absolutely necessary, as higher duties made most consignments uneconomical.
Enough stock
“We have enough stock of locally made Indian utilities and compacts from our Korean partners in the country. So, we can easily hold for a couple of months and see where these negotiations are going,” he said. “There is not pretty large amounts of impact from the tariffs at this point in time. I think in relative terms, we are probably impacted in a similar fashion to others. But we are working around those points and we are looking at ways to counter it with, let’s say, supply chain moves or production moves.”
He added that the company was not considering shifting production in response to tariffs. “Maybe they look different again eight months from now. So that’s not a point in time when you want to make big decisions and try to play hero for a day. I just hold my line, I just focus, and I manage in the day-to-day.”
Market share
CNH produced about 51,000 tractors in India last year, selling roughly 37,000 units in the domestic market. In August, it retailed 3,900 units and currently holds a 4.5 per cent market share. Marx said the company aims to double that share by 2030.
India’s tractor market is led by Mahindra & Mahindra, with a market share of more than 23 per cent. According to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations, the sector grew by 12 per cent year-on-year between April and August, retailing 384,253 units compared with 343,146 in the same period last year.
