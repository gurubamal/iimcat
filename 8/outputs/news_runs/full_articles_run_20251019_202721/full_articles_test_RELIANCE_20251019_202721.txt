--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joining in the push back against Tesla's proposed $1 trillion pay package for CEO Elon Musk, proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), urged shareholders to vote against the plan on November 6, Bloomberg reported.
It added that this is the second year in a row that ISS has opposed a pay package for Elon Musk, and urged shareholders to vote against it.
Among other reasons, ISS on October 17 expressed concern over Elon Musk's split attention between his five businesses, which include Tesla — the other four being Neuralink, SpaceX, the Boring Company and xAI.
In a guidance issued to shareholders ahead of the vote on November 6, ISS said that while the sky-high pay package is designed to retain Elon Musk at Tesla and keep his attention on the electronic vehicle (EV) maker, “there are no explicit requirements to ensure that this will be the case”.
It further cited “unmitigated concerns” with the plan’s magnitude and design, the report added.
In a post on Elon Musk-owned social media site X (formerly Twitter), Tesla posted a response to ISS's stance on the hefty compensation plan, and urged shareholders to back its recommendations.
“ISS once again completely misses fundamental points of investing and governance. They recommended against compensation that shareholders have voted on twice before (and that Elon has already earned), as well as the 2025 CEO Performance Award (where Elon receives nothing unless shareholders win big),” the company's official account posted.
It called ISS's recommendation as “unfounded and nonsensical”, and claimed that this “proves how disconnected from reality they are”.
“As Tesla’s longest-tenured independent director, Ira has created a governance framework that has allowed Tesla to achieve an astonishing TSR increase of ~39,000% during his tenure. He embodies our high-engagement Board – with hands-on leadership + effective governance with a focus on long-term value,” it added.
Tesla urged, “It’s easy for ISS to tell others how to vote when they have nothing on the line. Vote with Tesla on ALL proposals.”
On October 2, Tesla investors, including state officials, also opposed Tesla's $1 trillion pay package for Elon Musk, Forbes reported. Shareholders urged other investors to reject the pay package at Tesla's annual shareholder meeting on November 6, as per the report.
The letter, signed by prominent investors, including the SOC Investment Group, and American Federation of Teachers; the state treasurers of Nevada, New Mexico, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Colorado and the comptrollers of Maryland and New York City, accused the board of “harming Tesla's reputation” in their fight to retain Elon Musk.
Tesla shareholders will vote on the pay package at the annual meeting on November 6.
Notably, ISS and fellow proxy firm Glass Lewis both advised shareholders to also reject Elon Musk’s 2018 pay deal, where around 75 per cent of investors still supported the package.
In 2024, a Delaware judge struck down that plan after finding Elon Musk had undue influence over the process and the board had conflicts of interest. The world's richest person later cited the pay dispute as part of the reason why Tesla shifted its corporate home to Texas from Delaware.
Elon Musk and Tesla resumed their legal fight to appeal the ruling, this time before the Delaware Supreme Court on October 15.

Key Takeaways
- Proxy advisers like ISS can significantly influence shareholder decisions.
- Musk's compensation plan aims to retain his focus on Tesla amidst his various businesses.
- Concerns about conflicts of interest and governance persist in Musk's compensation proposals.

Title   : Reliance to start solar power generation from Kutch project in H1 FY27

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reliance Industries will commence solar power generation in the first half of the next financial year from its mega renewable energy project in Kutch, Gujarat, a site spread over an area nearly three times the size of Singapore.
The project is part of the oil-to-telecom conglomerate's broader push towards clean energy and achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2035.
In an investor presentation post announcement of its second quarter earnings, Reliance said project development across the 5,50,000-acre site in Kutch is progressing well, with engineering and feasibility studies completed, and the site is currently in various stages of land development.
"Expected to start commissioning solar generation during the first half of the next year for captive requirements plus green fuels production," it said.
Four years ago, Reliance Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani announced a $10 billion investment in a 'new energy' business. That was seen as a notable change of tide, given the conglomerate's mega-scale petroleum refining operation that Ambani spearheaded back in the 1990s.
With that, Reliance began work on a new integrated renewable energy manufacturing hub named after the group's founder - the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex.
At the company's annual shareholder meeting this year, Anant Ambani gave a glimpse into its scale. A build area four times the size of Tesla's gigafactory, a steel order large enough to build 100 Eiffel Towers and a stretch of cables enough to 'reach the moon and back'.
The gigafactories at Jamnagar - home to the company's refining and petrochemical complex - will produce gears used in generating electricity from sunlight and the battery value chain. Alongside, in Kutch, it is developing one of the world's largest single-site solar projects spanning 5,50,000 acres of arid land - three times the size of Singapore.
Reliance's clean energy plans span solar PV, battery storage, green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel.
The firm is on track to set up 20GWp of solar PV manufacturing capacity and 100GWh of battery giga-factory. Reliance has also pledged to produce 3 million tonnes per annum of green hydrogen by 2032, while manufacturing equipment like electrolysers, battery storage and solar panels in-house.
Solar photovoltaic giga-factory expansion
In the investor presentation, the company said it continues to gradually expand its solar photovoltaic giga-factory. "Already commissioned 4 PV module lines, and the first cell line is expected to be commissioned soon," Reliance said, adding that it is on track to achieve its targeted capacity and further expand in a modular fashion.
The PV solar manufacturing chain includes production of polysilicon - high-purity silicon produced from metallurgical grade silicon (sand). This is followed by ingot and wafer creation - polysilicon being melted and cooled to form ingots (either monocrystalline cylinders or multicrystalline blocks). These ingots are then sliced into thin wafers, which form the base of the solar cell.
Then comes the cell manufacturing - silicon wafers are processed through various steps, including doping, cleaning, and coating. Laser scribing is used to pattern the cells, and copper ribbons are applied for electrical connections.
Multiple cells are connected together and laminated between sheets of glass and encapsulant to create a waterproof module, or panel. These modules are then assembled into arrays with racking systems, which are support structures for mounting them on areas receiving sunlight.
With sunlight being available only during daytime, Reliance is also setting up gigafactories for the battery value chain to provide round-the-clock power.
"The work on Battery Energy Storage giga-factory is progressing at a rapid pace," the firm said, adding it has achieved significant construction and engineering progress on-site for 40 GWh manufacturing capacity, and production line equipment is on track for installation on the foundation.
