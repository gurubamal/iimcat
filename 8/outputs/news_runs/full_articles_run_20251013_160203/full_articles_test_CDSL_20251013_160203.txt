Nilesh Jain, Head – Technical and Derivatives Research Analyst at Centrum Broking said that Nifty managed to defend and close above its immediate support at the 25,200 mark despite today's losses. "The overall trend remains bullish as long Nifty trades above 25,050. A gradual upward move towards 25,400 appears likely in the near term. On the derivatives front, fresh CALL writing was observed at the 25,300 strike, which now holds the highest open interest (OI) on the Call side. A decisive break above 25,300 could trigger short covering, paving the way for further upside. Meanwhile, the base has shifted higher to the 25,200 strike, indicating strong support at that level," Jain said.
Here are 5 stock recommendations for Tuesday:
