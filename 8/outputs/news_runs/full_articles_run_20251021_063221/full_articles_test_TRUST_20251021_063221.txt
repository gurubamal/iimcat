--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
More differences have surfaced among the trustees of the Tata Trusts. This time it is over the upcoming reappointment of trustees Venu Srinivasan and Mehli Mistry, whose terms end on October 23 and 28, respectively.
Divisions among the trustees surfaced in September when four trustees—Mehli Mistry, Darius Khambatta, Jehangir H Jehangir and Pramit Jhaveri—opposed the renomination of another trustee, Vijay Singh, to the board of Tata Sons. Singh subsequently stepped down from the board of Tata Sons though he remains a trustee. Singh, Srinivasan and Noel Tata find themselves ranged against the other four named above.
A circular was sent to all trustees on Saturday about the expiry of the tenures of Srinivasan and Mistry. According to a source close to the trust, while the Mistry group believes that the reappointment is automatic as per a resolution passed in the trust board meeting a year ago, the other side insists that it is subject to voting by all trustees.
Incidentally, the said resolution passed in the board meeting on October 17 last year also stated that on reappointment, the trustee’s tenure will be permanent.
Here’s the resolution shared by a person close to the trusts: “The trustees recognised that they’re all equally responsible charged with public duty and specifically tasked by Mr. Ratan N Tata. To this end, they resolve that on the expiry of tenure of any trustee, that trustee will be reappointed by the concerned trust without any limit being attached to the period of tenure of such reappointment, and in accordance with law.”
A straight reading of the resolution would imply that Venu Srinivasan and Mehli Mistry are set to be reappointed to their existing positions. And when the reappointment happens this time, they will become permanent trustees.
But the other group, which counts Noel Tata, chairman of Tata Trusts in its midst, believes that any reappointment cannot be automatic and must be agreed upon by other trustees. This difference is likely to boil over this week even as it is understood that Mehli Mistry has already responded to the circular and pointed to last year’s resolution which does not specify voting.
While the trustees are battling it out amongst themselves, sources say they’re also wary about the squabble attracting the attention of the authorities and hence are unlikely to take recourse to the courts.
