Muhurat Trading: History and significance
Muhurat Trading is an age-old Diwali tradition initiated by the Bombay Stock Exchange in 1957, and continued by the National Stock Exchange since 1992. Historically, brokers performed Chopda Pujan, a ritualistic worship of account books, during this session to mark the auspicious start of the new financial year.The session traditionally coincides with Lakshmi Pujan, where traders and investors pray to Goddess Lakshmi for wealth and prosperity before placing trades. Beliefs around the tradition vary — Marwari traders were known to sell stocks to avoid bringing money into the home on Diwali, while Gujarati traders typically made purchases as a symbol of prosperity.
Though such beliefs may no longer hold universally, the symbolic value of Muhurat trading continues to be embraced.
What Happens During Muhurat Trading?
The trading session is divided into specific windows, including:- Block Deal Session – Bulk transactions between two parties.
- Pre-Open Session – Price discovery before live trading.
- Normal Market Session – The main one-hour trading window.
- Call Auction Session – For illiquid securities.
- Closing Session – Market orders at the closing price.
Who participates in Muhurat Trading?

- Retail investors view it as an auspicious entry point into the market.
- Experienced traders, who participate as a symbolic gesture and sometimes to lock in selective positions.
- Long-term investors use the opportunity to invest in strong fundamentals aligned with long-term financial goals.
