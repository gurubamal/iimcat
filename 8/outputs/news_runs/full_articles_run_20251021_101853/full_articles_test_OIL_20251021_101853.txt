Oil prices dipped on Monday, pressured by worries over a global glut as U.S.-China trade tensions added to concerns about an economic slowdown and weaker energy demand.
Brent crude futures were down 53 cents, or 0.86 per cent, at $60.76 a barrel as of 0610 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures fell 55 cents, or 0.96 per cent, to $56.99, erasing gains from Friday.
Both benchmarks declined more than 2 per cent last week, marking their third consecutive weekly decline, partly due to the International Energy Agency's outlook for a growing supply glut in 2026.
"Concerns about oversupply from increased production by oil- producing nations, coupled with fears of an economic slowdown stemming from escalating U.S.-China trade tensions, are fuelling selling pressure," said Toshitaka Tazawa, an analyst at Fujitomi Securities.
China's third-quarter economic growth slowed to the weakest pace in a year, data from China's statistics bureau showed on Monday. The results were pulled down by weak domestic demand, raising questions about Beijing's reliance on exports amid trade tensions with the U.S.
Last week, the head of the World Trade Organization said she had urged the U.S. and China to de-escalate trade tensions, warning that a decoupling by the world's two largest economies could reduce global economic output by 7 per cent over the longer term.
The two top oil consumers have recently renewed their trade war, imposing additional port fees on ships carrying cargo between them - tit-for-tat moves that could disrupt global freight flows.
Uncertainty remains over what may happen with Russian oil supply, with U.S. President Donald Trump warning again on Sunday that Washington would maintain "massive" tariffs on India unless it stopped buying Russian oil.
Meanwhile, Trump and Putin agreed on Thursday to hold another summit on the war in Ukraine, even as Washington pressured India and China to stop buying Russian oil.
Following talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the White House on Friday, Trump implored both Ukraine and Russia to "stop the war immediately," even if it means Ukraine conceding territory.
U.S. and European pressure on Asian buyers of Russian energy could restrict India's oil imports from December, leading to cheaper supplies for China, trade sources and analysts said.
On the supply side, U.S. energy firms last week added oil and natural gas rigs for the first time in three weeks, energy services firm Baker Hughes said in its closely followed report on Friday.

Oil prices fell for a second day on Tuesday as concerns about excess supply and risks to demand stemming from tensions between the U.S. and China, the world's top two oil consumers, weigh on the market.
Brent crude futures fell 17 cents, or 0.28%, at $60.84 a barrel at 0343 GMT. The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) contract for November delivery, set to expire on Tuesday, eased 0.52% to $57.22. The more active December contract was down 19 cents, or 0.33%, at $56.83.
Prices declined to their lowest since early May in Monday's session on the concerns about slowing economic growth from the recent escalations in the U.S.-China trade dispute.
Both WTI and Brent have shifted to contango market structures, where prices for immediate supply are lower than for later delivery and which typically indicates that near-term supply is abundant and demand weakening.
Prices have slumped as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies including Russia, known as OPEC+, have pushed ahead with plans to add more oil to the market. This has led analysts to predict a surplus of crude this year and next, with the
International Energy Agency last week projecting a global surplus of nearly 4 million barrels per day in 2026.
"The continued weakening of Brent's monthly spread structure indicates that the pressure from oversupply in the crude oil market is gradually materializing," analysts from China's Haitong Securities said in a note on Tuesday.
"This will dampen market expectations and curb investors' willingness to chase gains, limiting the potential for oil prices to rebound."
The current pessimistic outlook for oil is likely to extend into 2026, with analysts at Goldman Sachs saying on Tuesday they forecast Brent prices may drop to $52 a barrel by the fourth quarter of next year.
The Goldman analysts attributed the past week's slump in Brent prices to indications "the long-anticipated global surplus has started to show" in satellite data on global oil stockpiles and inventory data from the IEA and the Energy Information Administration in the U.S.
Expectations are that U.S. crude oil stockpiles likely rose last week, a preliminary Reuters poll on Monday showed, ahead of weekly reports from the American Petroleum Institute and the EIA.
