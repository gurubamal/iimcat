The net sales were posted at Rs 19,371 crore in Q2FY26, versus Rs 15,967 crore in the same quarter last year.
UltraTech Cement reported a robust 22.3% growth in domestic grey cement sales during the September 2025 quarter, excluding contributions from its newly acquired India Cements and Kesoram assets, which were not part of the company in the year-ago period.
This performance far exceeded the industry average growth of around 5%, underscoring UltraTech’s strong market position and operational execution.
The company benefited from a 7% year-on-year decline in energy costs, though raw material expenses rose 5% due to higher prices of flyash and slag. For its existing operations, operating EBITDA per ton stood at Rs 966, based on a capacity of 166.76 mtpa.
The recently acquired assets of India Cements and Kesoram generated operating EBITDA of Rs 386 per ton and Rs 755 per ton, respectively. Integration progress has been swift, with 55% of Kesoram’s volumes and 31% of India Cements’ volumes already transitioned under the UltraTech brand.

UltraTech Cement, an Aditya Birla Group company, has announced a fresh capex of ₹10,255 crore to expand its cement production capacity by 22.8 mtpa, including that of its subsidiary India Cements.
The investment plan was approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting held here on Saturday.
It will be executed through a mix of brownfield and greenfield projects.
Commercial production from these new capacities is expected to go fully on stream in a phased manner, starting from FY28 and will catapult the company’s cement capacity to 240.76 mtpa globally.
Over the past decade, UltraTech has added over 65 mtpa capacity through the inorganic growth.
Kumar Mangalam Birla, Chairman, Aditya Birla Group said the latest capacity expansion follows over ₹50,000 crore invested over the past five years.
The investment reflects the company’s confidence in the Indian economy and the scale of its infrastructure ambitions, he said.
When capital is deployed strategically, it energises ecosystems, deepens industrial linkages and creates durable employment, he added.
As India enters a transformative era of infrastructure and economic development, UltraTech is well-positioned to meet the rising demand for cement, he said.
