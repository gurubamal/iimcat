Drugmaker Cipla has a customized stamp released by India Post to mark 90 years of the company. The ₹5 stamp has the image of Cipla doyen Dr YK Hamied, with its more recent office in Mumbai as the backdrop.
In January this year, multinational drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline had a stamp released by India Post to mark GSK’s 100 years in the country.
Cipla turned 90 in August, but the customised stamp was released by the Department of Posts in September, a spokesperson for the company said. It was released by Suchita Joshi, Postmaster General, Navi Mumbai, with Dr Hamied and brother MK Hamied being present along with other Cipla employees, besides being live-streamed to Cipla’s global offices and sites.
On reaching the 90s milestone, Hamied had told shareholders earlier this year, that the company would continue along the same path of providing accessible and quality products, for India and across the world. “Cipla continues to be among the leading generic pharmaceutical companies, not only in India, but also in Africa, USA, Europe and has a growing presence in selected markets around the world,” he had told shareholders. Looking ahead, he said, the company would focus on respiratory, cardiac, cancer, obesity and mental health segments, besides the critical area of anti-microbials.
