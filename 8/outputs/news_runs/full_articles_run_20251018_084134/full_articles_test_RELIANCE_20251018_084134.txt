--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Delhi: Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd, Reliance Industries Ltd’s retail arm, on Friday reported a consolidated profit of ₹3,457 crore for the September quarter, up 22% from a year ago.
Revenue from operations grew 19% year-on-year to ₹79,128 crore.
The retailer's Ebitda rose 16.5% year-on-year to ₹6,816 crore, while Ebitda margin fell by 20 basis points to 8.6%. Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and is a measure of core operations.
Reliance Retail operates across categories such as grocery, consumer electronics, fashion and lifestyle, and online commerce.
Isha M. Ambani, executive director, Reliance Retail Ventures, on Friday said the business delivered strong performance during the quarter led by the company's focus on operational excellence, investments in stores and digital platforms and festive buying across consumption baskets.
“GST rate changes will further accelerate consumption growth as consumers get the benefit of lower prices… We consistently innovate, from curating new collections to creating campaigns that connect with today's Indian consumer, and our focus remains on building brands that inspire and resonate across India,” she added.
Grocery and fashion & lifestyle businesses grew 23% and 22% year-on-year, respectively, led by festive buying. Consumer electronics delivered 18% year-on-year growth aided by GST rate reduction and new launches.
RRVL's earnings closely coincide with Dhanteras and Diwali; the quarter also saw GST-linked disruptions that hurt sales in the first half of September. Nonetheless, categories such as air conditioners and televisions, sold under its Reliance Digital retail brand, benefited the company due to a reduction in tax rates.
The company reported a consolidated profit of ₹3,271 crore in the April-June quarter, up 28.3% from a year ago. Revenue from operations grew 11.3% year-on-year to ₹73,720 crore.
Reliance Retail opened 412 new stores during the September quarter, taking its total store count to 19,821, up 4.6% year-on-year.
Despite adding new stores, area under operations shrunk 2% to 77.8 million square feet in the September quarter versus 79.4 million sq. ft. in the year-ago period. In the year-ago period, it added 464 new stores, while in the June quarter it opened 388 new stores.
Last fiscal year, the company's retail business saw a period of subdued performance primarily due to an operational rationalisation done by the company that saw the retailer shutter large format stores across categories such as grocery and fashion to open smaller stores across formats.
However, during the company's June quarter earnings call, the management had said the business is now on the path of growing its store network.
“We believe improvement in retail should act as a catalyst for the stock, especially given the implied low valuation for retail. We expect core retail to grow 12% year-on-year top line with FY25-28E CAGR at 13% (vs 5% year-on-year in FY25). Analysts expected the retail business to grow at 14% year-on-year, partially helped by a favorable base (impacted by strategic recalibration of store network),” said Axis Bank analysts in a 13 October report.
The company's grocery business saw double-digit growth year-on-year in core categories with packaged food grew by 20%, staples grew by 18%, and home and personal care (HPC) grew by 13%. Additionally, the volume of fruits and vegetables was up by 62% year-on-year.
The company’s consumer electronics business growth was driven by the festive build-up, though demand was impacted between the announcement and implementation of lower GST rates on 22nd September 2025, with a strong pickup occurring after that date. Laptops grew by 37%, Mobiles grew by 22%, and appliances grew by 10% on year-on-year basis.
Additionally, RIL has initiated a restructuring to spin off its fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) brands into a new entity, New Reliance Consumer Products Ltd (New RCPL), ahead of its much-anticipated IPO of its retail business. As part of the restructuring, RCPL will operate as a direct subsidiary of RIL. It was earlier a step-down subsidiary through Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd.
The RCPL demerger is a process in progress, and is awaiting a final order from the National Company Law Tribunal, it said on Friday.
In the September quarter, the company's fast-moving consumer goods business reported gross revenue of ₹5,400 crore.
Its cola brand Campa sustained double-digit market share in key markets for Campa, with positive growth momentum across categories led by Campa and Independence.
At the company's 48th annual general meeting in August, management set a revenue target of ₹1 trillion for its packaged consumer products business, RCPL, in five years.

Reliance Industries-owned Reliance Retail Ventures registered a 21.8 per cent increase in profit after tax at ₹3,457 crore in the quarter that ended September 30, compared to ₹2,836 crore registered in the same period last year.

The company stated that the grocery, fashion and lifestyle businesses grew 23 per cent and 22 per cent year-on-year, respectively. Consumer electronics delivered 18 per cent year-on-year growth, aided by GST rate reduction and new launches.
new stores
During the quarter, Reliance Retail opened 412 new stores, with the company’s total store count to 19,821 stores. The company stated it expanded its customer base to 358 million.
“Reliance Retail delivered a strong performance during the quarter, led by our relentless focus on operational excellence, investments in stores and digital platforms and festive buying across consumption baskets.

We consistently innovate, from curating new collections to creating campaigns that connect with today’s Indian consumer, and our focus remains on building brands that inspire and resonate across India,” said Isha M Ambani, Executive Director, Reliance Retail Ventures Limited.
Consumer electronics
The consumer electronics segment growth was driven by the festival build-up, though the company acknowledged that the demand was impacted between the announcement and implementation of lower GST rates, with a strong pick up occurring after the implementation of GST. On a year-on-year basis, laptops grew by 37 per cent, mobiles grew by 22 per cent and appliances grew by 10 per cent
JioMart saw a 120 per cent quarter-on-quarter growth rate with 5.8 million new customers. The Quick Hyper local commerce offering extended its operations across 5,000 pin codes and was serviced by over 3,000 stores in more than 1,000 cities.
“The fashion and lifestyle business delivered strong growth with the onset of the festival season. Emerging formats, such as Yousta and Azorte, registered a growth of 66 per cent y-o-y, and Yousta reached the significant milestone of 100 stores. The business tapped into regional festivals, such as Pujo in Navratri, through strong promotions, which resulted in eastern markets delivering their best-ever sales. There was a pick-up in ethnic wear categories during the early festive period, and smart casuals and semi-formals also performed well, strengthening the own brands’ play. A strategic shift occurred from seasonal fashion to fresh fashion every day, creating newness in the range with the introduction of over 300 new options per week. AJIO represented a 35 per cent year-on-year increase, and launched several new brands on its platform,” the company informed the stock exchanges.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reliance Industries reported a 9.7 per cent rise in consolidated net profit in the second quarter, and revenue up 10 per cent, led by oil-to-chemicals, retail and digital services.
The conglomerate reported net profit of ₹18,165 crore on revenue of ₹2.6 lakh crore.
The company said there was a strong contribution from the consumer business, while a recovery in the O2C business led to its highest quarterly throughput of 20.8 million tonnes, up 3 per cent on year.
Commenting on the robust performance, Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani said it reflected the agile business operations, domestic-focused portfolio and structural growth in the Indian economy.
The O2C segment contributed half of total revenue, while retail and digital together accounted for around 42 per cent, an indicator of the changing business mix of RIL.
Despite continued volatility in the energy markets, the O2C business did good business with the recovery in fuel margins. Its EBITDA at ₹12,413 crore rose 21 per cent, led by a sharp recovery in fuel cracks and improvement in polymer deltas. EBITDA margin improved 130 bps.
Digital services business was scaling up and in Jio, “We continue to augment our capabilities with pioneering systems and platforms, ensuring the benefits of the ever-evolving technology landscape for all Indians,” Ambani said.
Sustained improvement in ARPUs, robust subscriber adds, as well as a 30 per cent increase in data traffic contributed to the performance of digital services, which was the highest contributor to the overall group EBITDA.
RIL is preparing to list Jio in the first half of 2026 and this will unlock value in the digital services business.
The retail segment is the second largest revenue contributor and Reliance Retail, as part of its expansion, has signed agreements to set up food parks across several states.
The downstream chemicals business continued to be hampered by overcapacity. “Corrective steps by industry stakeholders will help balance global downstream markets in the medium-term,” he said.
Lower production in the KGD6 basin was offset to some extent by higher price realisation and the management said it was exploring other areas to augment volumes.
In the new energy business, RIL has grand plans to provide clean energy around the clock, and it has already commissioned four PV modules, while the first cell line will be commissioned soon. It expects to start generating solar power in the first half of next year for captive purposes.
The capital expenditure during the quarter at around ₹40,000 crore, which was 66 per cent lower from the first quarter. Its outstanding debt at the end of September rose around 3 per cent to Rs 3.5 lakh crore.

The company's revenue form operations in the quarter under review stood at Rs 2.59 lakh crore, which was up 10% over Rs 2.35 lakh crore in the corresponding quarter of the last financial year.
While PAT missed Street's estimate of Rs 18,643 crore, the topline beat estimates of Rs 2.51 lakh crore.
The gross revenue for RIL stood at Rs 2.83 lakh crore which was also up 10% on a YoY basis.
The company's Earning's Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) in the quarter under review stood at Rs 50,367 crore, up 15% YoY. The EBITDA margin was reported at 17.8%, gaining 80 bps over the corresponding quarter of the last financial year.
RIL's sequential PAT took a 33% dip compared to Rs 26,994 crore in Q1FY26 while revenue was 4% higher QoQ versus Rs 2.49 lakh crore.
RIL Segment-wise Performance
Jio Platfoms' revenue increased by 14.9% YoY led by industry leading subscriber growth across mobility and homes, sustained improvement in ARPU and continued ramp-up in digital service offerings.The retail arm Reliance Retail Ventures Limited's (RVVL) revenue increased by 18% YoY, with significant growth across consumption baskets. Grocery and Fashion delivered market leading performance growing 23% and 22% respectively. The consumer electronics division delivered 18% YoY growth aided by GST rate reduction and new launches.
The Oil to Chemicals (O2C) revenue increased by 3.2% YoY. Production meant for sale increased 2.3% on a YoY basis. Company’s fuel retailing operations through Jio-bp further expanded its domestic placement of transportation fuels. Jio-bp achieved a volume growth of 34% for HSD and 32% for MS.
Oil & Gas segment revenue decreased by 2.6% YoY mainly on account of natural decline of production in KGD6, and lower condensate price realisation. This was partly offset with improved KGD6 gas price realisation and higher volume of CBM.
JPL's EBITDA increased by 17.7% YoY primarily driven by revenue growth and 140 bps margin expansion. For RRVL, EBITDA increased by 16.5% YoY led by higher revenue with ramp-up in store-footprint and hyperlocal deliveries, favourable mix, and focus on operational efficiencies.
The O2C EBITDA increased by 20.9% YoY with sharp increase in transportation fuel cracks and, sustained volume growth in domestic fuel retailing. For downstream chemicals, positive impact of higher polymer deltas were partially offset by weakness in polyester chain margins.
And for Oil & Gas segment, EBITDA decreased by 5.4% YoY on account of lower KGD6 gas volumes, and higher operating costs on account of periodic maintenance activities.

Title   : Proxy adviser ISS urges Tesla shareholders to reject Elon Musk's $1 trillion pay package ahead of Nov 6 vote

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joining in the push back against Tesla's proposed $1 trillion pay package for CEO Elon Musk, proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), urged shareholders to vote against the plan on November 6, Bloomberg reported.
It added that this is the second year in a row that ISS has opposed a pay package for Elon Musk, and urged shareholders to vote against it.
Among other reasons, ISS on October 17 expressed concern over Elon Musk's split attention between his five businesses, which include Tesla — the other four being Neuralink, SpaceX, the Boring Company and xAI.
In a guidance issued to shareholders ahead of the vote on November 6, ISS said that while the sky-high pay package is designed to retain Elon Musk at Tesla and keep his attention on the electronic vehicle (EV) maker, “there are no explicit requirements to ensure that this will be the case”.
It further cited “unmitigated concerns” with the plan’s magnitude and design, the report added.
In a post on Elon Musk-owned social media site X (formerly Twitter), Tesla posted a response to ISS's stance on the hefty compensation plan, and urged shareholders to back its recommendations.
“ISS once again completely misses fundamental points of investing and governance. They recommended against compensation that shareholders have voted on twice before (and that Elon has already earned), as well as the 2025 CEO Performance Award (where Elon receives nothing unless shareholders win big),” the company's official account posted.
It called ISS's recommendation as “unfounded and nonsensical”, and claimed that this “proves how disconnected from reality they are”.
“As Tesla’s longest-tenured independent director, Ira has created a governance framework that has allowed Tesla to achieve an astonishing TSR increase of ~39,000% during his tenure. He embodies our high-engagement Board – with hands-on leadership + effective governance with a focus on long-term value,” it added.
Tesla urged, “It’s easy for ISS to tell others how to vote when they have nothing on the line. Vote with Tesla on ALL proposals.”
On October 2, Tesla investors, including state officials, also opposed Tesla's $1 trillion pay package for Elon Musk, Forbes reported. Shareholders urged other investors to reject the pay package at Tesla's annual shareholder meeting on November 6, as per the report.
The letter, signed by prominent investors, including the SOC Investment Group, and American Federation of Teachers; the state treasurers of Nevada, New Mexico, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Colorado and the comptrollers of Maryland and New York City, accused the board of “harming Tesla's reputation” in their fight to retain Elon Musk.
Tesla shareholders will vote on the pay package at the annual meeting on November 6.
Notably, ISS and fellow proxy firm Glass Lewis both advised shareholders to also reject Elon Musk’s 2018 pay deal, where around 75 per cent of investors still supported the package.
In 2024, a Delaware judge struck down that plan after finding Elon Musk had undue influence over the process and the board had conflicts of interest. The world's richest person later cited the pay dispute as part of the reason why Tesla shifted its corporate home to Texas from Delaware.
Elon Musk and Tesla resumed their legal fight to appeal the ruling, this time before the Delaware Supreme Court on October 15.
(With inputs from Bloomberg)
Key Takeaways
- Proxy advisers like ISS can significantly influence shareholder decisions.
- Musk's compensation plan aims to retain his focus on Tesla amidst his various businesses.
- Concerns about conflicts of interest and governance persist in Musk's compensation proposals.
