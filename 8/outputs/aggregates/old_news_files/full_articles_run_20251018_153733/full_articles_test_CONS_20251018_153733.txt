The net sales were posted at Rs 19,371 crore in Q2FY26, versus Rs 15,967 crore in the same quarter last year.
UltraTech Cement reported a robust 22.3% growth in domestic grey cement sales during the September 2025 quarter, excluding contributions from its newly acquired India Cements and Kesoram assets, which were not part of the company in the year-ago period.
This performance far exceeded the industry average growth of around 5%, underscoring UltraTech’s strong market position and operational execution.
The company benefited from a 7% year-on-year decline in energy costs, though raw material expenses rose 5% due to higher prices of flyash and slag. For its existing operations, operating EBITDA per ton stood at Rs 966, based on a capacity of 166.76 mtpa.
The recently acquired assets of India Cements and Kesoram generated operating EBITDA of Rs 386 per ton and Rs 755 per ton, respectively. Integration progress has been swift, with 55% of Kesoram’s volumes and 31% of India Cements’ volumes already transitioned under the UltraTech brand.
“UltraTech’s expansion program is progressing as scheduled, with the Company continuously enhancing its production capabilities. UltraTech’s domestic grey cement capacity is 186.86 mtpa, on a consolidated basis. Together with its overseas capacity of 5.4 mtpa, the Company’s global capacity stands at 192.26 mtpa. UltraTech also migrated to the GST 2.0 framework effective September 22, 2025, ensuring that customers receive the full benefit of the reduction in GST rates,” the company said while commenting on its capacity expansion.
