New Delhi [India], : South Korea's top conglomerate leaders joined U.S. President Donald Trump for a round of golf in Florida, in what observers view as an effort to strengthen economic and diplomatic ties between the two countries, as reported by the Pulse, the English service of Maeil Business Newspaper Korea.
The business leaders met Trump and other global executives at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach on Saturday, local time. It was the first known instance of a sitting U.S. president playing golf with Korean business leaders.
The participants reportedly included Samsung Electronics Co. Executive Chairman Jay Y. Lee, SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won, Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Euisun Chung, LG Group Chairman Koo Kwang-mo, and Hanwha Group Vice Chairman Kim Dong-kwan.
SoftBank Group Chairman Masayoshi Son is said to have organized the meeting.
According to the White House press pool, Trump arrived at the course at 9:15 a.m. and left around 4:50 p.m., spending roughly seven hours at the venue. It was his 11th round there since returning to office.
The Korean executives reportedly traveled together in an airport limousine bus rather than private vehicles. A black bus believed to be carrying them left the course shortly after Trump's departure and was seen heading to a five-star hotel on Palm Beach Island, where Son was later spotted in the lobby along with aides accompanying the Korean delegation.
It remains unclear who played in Trump's group.
The event was believed to have followed a shotgun start format, in which players begin simultaneously on different holes.
While few details have been confirmed, the gathering was reportedly more than a social occasion. People familiar with the matter said discussions may have touched on investment and trade issues in North America.
The meeting took place as Seoul and Washington are in the final stage of trade negotiations. It also comes as Korean conglomerates expand large-scale U.S. investments in sectors including semiconductors, batteries, automobiles, and energy.
"It's likely that President Trump held in-depth discussions with the heads of major Korean companies," said an industry source. "Given that all the country's top business leaders were present, the meeting probably went beyond a simple round of golf."

Title   : Novo Nordisk hires US pharma veteran as Trump pricing pressure mounts

Novo Nordisk has appointed U.S. pharmaceutical executive Greg Miley as its new global head of corporate affairs, as the obesity drugmaker faces growing pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump on drug pricing. Miley recently served as senior vice president of government affairs at U.S. pharmaceutical giant AbbVie. He posted a statement about his appointment on LinkedIn on Friday and Novo Nordisk shared the statement with Reuters.
A Novo spokesperson said on Saturday that Miley would join the company in early November, overseeing global communication and global public affairs. Novo is turning to an American executive with deep U.S. pharmaceutical experience to help navigate political risks under the Trump administration in the United States, its largest market.
NEW HIRE TO FOCUS ON RELATIONS WITH TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
The appointment comes as new CEO Mike Doustdar tries to revive investor confidence through a restructuring to sharpen Novo's focus in a fierce obesity drug battle against U.S. rival Eli Lilly. The overhaul includes cutting 9,000 jobs, with 5,000 positions being eliminated in Denmark and layoffs under way across multiple U.S. departments. "In this new role, I see great potential to strengthen our Global Communication and Public Affairs efforts," Miley wrote on LinkedIn, adding that he would relocate to Denmark, Novo's home market.
Miley's urgent priority will be improving Novo's relations with the Trump administration, said a source familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential information. Other big pharmaceutical companies have hired public affairs experts with long backgrounds in Republican circles in order to navigate the administration's pressures on the industry, a source at a European drugmaker told Reuters on Friday.
TRUMP SAYS OZEMPIC PRICE IN US WILL BE LOWERED
Shares of Novo and Lilly fell on Friday after Trump said that the price of Novo's Ozempic diabetes treatment would be lowered. Ozempic contains the same active ingredient as its weight-loss drug Wegovy.
Miley spent the past decade at AbbVie in Chicago and was promoted two years ago to senior vice president of government affairs, according to his LinkedIn profile. He has worked in the pharmaceutical industry since 2004, building his career at U.S. drugmakers including more than four years in public affairs at Abbott and nearly five years at Pfizer.
AbbVie did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Miley did not reply when contacted by Reuters earlier on Friday.
