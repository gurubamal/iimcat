Happy Diwali to everyone except NSE and BSE…
— Gurmeet Chadha (@connectgurmeet) October 20, 2025
What is this greed ? Why cant we remain closed for 1 DAY on the largest festival of the nation…
So many market intermediaries working today….
Chadha pointed out that several market intermediaries and participants were compelled to work on the holiday, dampening the spirit of the festival.
Traditionally, Indian stock exchanges conduct a Muhurat trading session on Diwali, symbolising prosperity and new beginnings. However, this year, with broader market operations continuing alongside the symbolic session, voices like Chadha’s have reignited debate on maintaining the sanctity of the festival versus market convenience.
While Diwali is being celebrated on many parts of India today, Indian stock markets will remain closed on Tuesday and Wednesday i.e. October 21 and October 22 on account of Laxmi Pujan and Diwali Balipratipada.
However, there will be a 'Muhurat' trading session on Tuesday which is a one hours session on the day of Diwali. Traditionally, Indian stock exchanges conduct a Muhurat trading session on this day, symbolising prosperity and new beginnings.
The Muhurat Trading session will be held between 1:45 pm and 2:45 pm, with modification allowed till 2:55 pm. Trading will be permitted across all market segments, including equities, derivatives, currency, and commodities.

Market participants view this session as an auspicious start for wealth creation, and investors across India, from seasoned traders to first-time retail buyers, often participate in the short, festive window.
Chadha regularly voices his opinion of stock markets and financial issues on the microblogging platform X.
Recently when the markets were witnessing sharp corrections amid foreign money outflows, Chadha suggested staying in the game and remaining patient as a key for investors. For him, the turnaround could be a double-digit earnings growth and unleashing of more reforms.

Muhurat Trading: History and significance
Muhurat Trading is an age-old Diwali tradition initiated by the Bombay Stock Exchange in 1957, and continued by the National Stock Exchange since 1992. Historically, brokers performed Chopda Pujan, a ritualistic worship of account books, during this session to mark the auspicious start of the new financial year.The session traditionally coincides with Lakshmi Pujan, where traders and investors pray to Goddess Lakshmi for wealth and prosperity before placing trades. Beliefs around the tradition vary — Marwari traders were known to sell stocks to avoid bringing money into the home on Diwali, while Gujarati traders typically made purchases as a symbol of prosperity.
Though such beliefs may no longer hold universally, the symbolic value of Muhurat trading continues to be embraced.
What Happens During Muhurat Trading?
The trading session is divided into specific windows, including:- Block Deal Session – Bulk transactions between two parties.
- Pre-Open Session – Price discovery before live trading.
- Normal Market Session – The main one-hour trading window.
- Call Auction Session – For illiquid securities.
- Closing Session – Market orders at the closing price.
Who participates in Muhurat Trading?
- Muhurat Trading typically sees active involvement from:
- Retail investors view it as an auspicious entry point into the market.
- Experienced traders, who participate as a symbolic gesture and sometimes to lock in selective positions.
- Long-term investors use the opportunity to invest in strong fundamentals aligned with long-term financial goals.
