With the reduction of GST on vehicles, Indian automaker Tata Motors has seen a 30 per cent year-on-year growth this Dhanteras.
The company is also witnessing an uptick in demand across all of its vehicle segments and is expected to deliver 25,000 vehicles during the Dhanteras and Diwali period.
“This year, Dhanteras and Diwali deliveries are spread over two to three days in line with the auspicious mahurats. Overall demand has been robust, and the GST 2.0 reform has further provided positive momentum. We expect to deliver over 25,000 vehicles during this period,” said Amit Kamat, Chief Commercial Officer, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles.
The GST Council slashed GST rates on cars up to 4 metres in length and up to 1,200cc engines to 18 per cent from 28 per cent and also removed the cess, making vehicles cheaper. This resulted in increasing customer footfalls at showrooms with customers test-driving various models especially small cars.
“I was a bit dubious about whether to buy the car this year or wait until the beginning of next year. However, the announcement of GST 2.0 implementation and the attractive festive discounts ultimately convinced me to make the purchase this festive season. Dealers were also under pressure to clear existing stock ahead of GST 2.0, which worked in my favour and I managed to get an overall discount of approximately ₹ 1 lakh. The only minor challenge I faced was finding the Royal Blue colour in the Creative CNG model of the Tata Altroz, which was in high demand. To secure the best offer and ensure timely delivery, I made enquiries and tentative bookings with multiple dealers before September 22. The delivery process was smooth, and the dealership team was helpful with all the documentation and formalities throughout,” said Ritik Jaiswal, a resident of Kanpur.
Further, for the festive season automobile dealers across the country have also increased their inventories and placed up to 20 per cent additional orders with OEMs across passenger vehicles, two-wheelers, and commercial vehicles after witnessing a surge in consumer enquiries.
