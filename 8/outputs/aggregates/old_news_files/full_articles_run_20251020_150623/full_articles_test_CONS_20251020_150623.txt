Consumer product makers across categories, including packaged food, durables, automobiles, ethnic apparel and gifting among others, are witnessing a robust uptick in sales during the Diwali festive weekend fuelled by buoyant buying sentiment.
Vikram Agarwal, MD, Greendot Health Foods, known for snacking brand Cornitos, said, “Based on what we are seeing in the market and from conversations with retailers, I think this year will be a bumper Diwali. GST rate cuts and attractive promotional offers across channels are fuelling this demand. We have also seen strong demand for gifting packs from both consumers and corporates with some stockists reporting stock out situation. We expect to end the festival season with 20-25 per cent growth.”
“We are seeing about 12-15 per cent growth due to strong consumption momentum driven by festive buying and GST rate cuts. On quick commerce channel alone, sales have been 30-40 per cent higher than non-festive period,” said Mayank Shah, Vice-President, Parle Products.
Festive drive
Automobile companies are also witnessing a sparkling Diwali season. Maruti Suzuki India said it expects to sell around 51,000 units this Dhanteras, the highest-ever sales on the auspicious day. Hyundai Motor India too said Dhanteras deliveries alone will be 20 per cent higher than last year.
Consumer durables firms and retailers are also witnessing a strong uptick in demand driven by premium products such as large screen LED TVs, front-load and top-load fully automatic washing machines and frost-free refrigerators. Companies such as Godrej Appliances and Haier India said that they are on track to garner high double-digit growth this festival season.
Praveen Khandelwal, Secretary General, the Confederation of All India Traders and Member of Parliament from Chandni Chowk, Delhi on Sunday stated that the industry body expects this year’s Diwali to generate sales exceeding ₹5 lakh crore. He added markets across the country are witnessing massive crowds this festive season.
Fashion rush
Ethnic apparel companies are also eyeing double-digit growth. Sidhant Keshwani, Founder and CEO, Libas said, “This Diwali is shaping up to be stronger than last year. GST 2.0 reforms have contributed to the momentum, and our curated collections and targeted campaigns are resonating well with the festive shoppers. We are seeing a 10 per cent year-on-year growth, reflecting strong engagement and interest from our customers.”
Siddharath Bindra, MD BIBA Fashion Ltd, said the brand is witnessing a “good double-digit growth over last year” driven by festive and occasion wear segments.

Smart cities in India are coming up, but in the meantime smart villages are also getting into the picture and a conglomerate of 100 companies is making that possible, under the Voice of Indian Communication Technology, Enterprises (VoICE), which expects to get projects under the government’s various schemes.
These homegrown companies have come up to make smart villages. One live example is of India’s first smart village - Satnavari in Maharashtra, where 24 companies from VoICE have come together to provide comprehensive rural health care, smart street lighting, surveillance, pesticide spraying by drones, smart cattle rearing, etc.
“The Smart Intelligent Village is a showcase of how 100 per cent indigenous technology and solutions can help achieve Atmanirbhar Bharat and Viksit Bharat. Along with enabling connectivity, which is the backbone for digitisation, this consortium has also showcased solutions which ensure villages are future ready,” Keerthi Lal, Founder - EarthTwin, a start-up incubated at IIT-Delhi, told businessline.
Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had launched this smart village in Nagpur, and said that his government plans to transform 10 villages in every taluka—3,500 in the first phase by 2030.
The consortium was in talks with various state governments, sighting the example of Satnavari, so that maximum number of villages across India can get similar services, he said adding that there is a huge opportunity with more than 6.50 lakh villages in India.
EarthTwin is a climate-smart agriculture solution, built on India’s only sustainability enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. The mobile-app-based solution promotes natural farming and provides timely advice to farmers on best next steps for a crop using artificial intelligence (AI).
“Further, with government announcing carbon credits for agriculture, eligible farmers can access them seamlessly through this platform,” Lal added.
Like EarthTwin, Insta ICT Solutions is also part of this project. Being a system integrator, it provides public Wi-Fi hotspots at gram panchayats (GPs) to extend BharatNet connectivity (up to 100 Mbps) for community access.
“Through these public hotspots we are enabling e-governance, information access and improving incomes. The best part of these projects is that we are doing it through indigenous technology and solutions,” Yeshwant Shinde, Co-founder, CEO and Director, Insta ICT Solutions, said.
When asked about revenue models, both Lal and Shinde said that they are channelising various government schemes through such projects with the consortium (VoICE), and charging minimal fee from the villagers on the services.
For instance, at the healthcare centre, a nominal fee is levied from the villagers for registration and services like on-the-spot testing for 120+ vital parameters, including blood, cardiac, ECG, etc, are done, Shinde added.
