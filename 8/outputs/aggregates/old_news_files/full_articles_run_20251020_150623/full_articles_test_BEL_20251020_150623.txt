Shed lethargy: Revanth
We all know that a school principal is the head of a school, responsible for its overall operation, including managing staff, overseeing the budget, and ensuring a safe and effective learning environment for students. Imagine a Chief Minister wearing the school principal’s hat!
Recently, Telangana Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy ticked off erring officials in the State. Reddy warned that Principal Secretaries, Secretaries and Heads of Departments should get serious about implementing government schemes and development works, an official communique after the CM meeting said.
“The Chief Minister reminded the officials that the government will not tolerate if any dereliction of their duties from them..,” the statement said.
The straight-talking Reddy has directed officials to shed their lethargy and perform their duties in tune with the government’s goals and objectives by coordinating with other departments.
On the prowl
“When I prepare for exams, I don’t only prepare for Math. I also prepare for Science, history, geography, etc. Ultimately, my aim is to become the topper in the class,” RBL Bank chief R Subramaniakumar, cryptically said, when specifically asked about who all, besides Emirates NBD, expressed an interest in buying substantial stake in the bank.
A senior RBL Bank official noted that large financial entities from the Middle-East, Japan and Singapore are actively scouting for assets in the Indian financial services space besides Emirates NBD, which has expressed an interest in buying substantial stake in RBL Bank.
Layoffs ahead
Layoffs in the technology sector have been grabbing headlines and if you thought that the season for firings is over, brace yourself for some more of that in the months ahead. A top-notch software company — which has already been laying off people in thousands — will be letting go of more people in the future, according to a top executive, and a good part of that will be in India. Reskilling, upskilling, different skills, AI-ready — whatever the term, jobs are going to go.
Marketing fiasco
Reporters across news bureaus received a rather “special” request from the public relation (PR) agency and marketing team of a mid-sized bank.
The bank had reported a double digit fall on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis in net profit for Q2FY26 on account of higher provisions.
The PR and marketing teams wanted reporters to not use y-o-y de-growth in net profit as the headline and instead highlight the quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) rise in net profit in the headline to “protect brand image”.
It is astonishing to see the lengths to which PR and marketing teams go today to enforce their managements’ diktats on reporters.
Big bet on bullion
Despite the run-away gold and silver prices becoming talk of the town during this Dhanteras, it seems no product can be sold without borrowing a tagline from the mutual fund industry.
MMTC-PAMP India, one of the largest sellers of gold and silver coins, has come out with an online advertisement wooing buyers saying ‘Sona sahi hai’. Now, buyers only hope that their buys do not go ‘galat’.
