Announced on September 15, the collaboration leverages CrowdStrike Falcon Next-Gen SIEM to simplify threat detection, enhance visibility, and automate responses through a modern SOC (Security Operations Center) that uses artificial intelligence to streamline decision-making and improve efficiency.
The new offering, which comes amid rising global concerns around cyber threats and data breaches, is expected to bolster Wipro’s position in the high-growth cybersecurity services market. Organisations increasingly face fragmented security architectures, rising costs, and alert fatigue. CyberShield MDR aims to address these pain points through AI-driven threat detection, proactive breach protection, and continuous monitoring.
The platform integrates capabilities from Wipro Ventures' portfolio companies, including Simbian and Tuskria, to deliver next-gen response systems. Wipro’s global network of eight Cyber Defense Centers (CDCs) will support the delivery and management of these services.
"Wipro’s CyberShield platform, powered by CrowdStrike’s AI-native product suites and strengthened by our security ecosystem, will help enterprises contain threats swiftly and ensure continuity of digital operations," said Tony Buffomante, Senior Vice President & Global Head – Cybersecurity & Risk Services, Wipro Limited. "This integrated platform approach enables AI automated workflows, prevents lateral threat movement, and eliminates potential security gaps that fragmented solutions often miss."
