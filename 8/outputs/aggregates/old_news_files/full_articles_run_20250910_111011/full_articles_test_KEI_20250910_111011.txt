The Global Fintech Fest that kicks off on October 7 this year will see Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sharing the stage with the UK’s PM Keir Starmer.
With the theme ‘Empowering finance for a better world powered by AI,’ the event has a star-studded speaker lineup including Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Minister of Railways, Information & Broadcasting and Electronics & Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw, RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra and Sebi chairperson Tuhin Kanta Pandey.
This year GFF is being held in the midst of tariff-induced turmoil in the global economy, while India is at the receiving end of 50 per cent duty imposed on its goods entering the US.
Free trade agreement
India has already signed a free trade agreement with the UK in July, which will significantly lower trade barriers between the two countries.
In a curtain raiser for the event, it was revealed that the event, which usually attracts large crowds, will be attended by 500-odd investors from across the globe, while over 5000 corporates are expected to be at the event, including fintechs from India and overseas.
The event is also a platform for start-up founders to connect with potential investors and Gaurav Chopra, Executive Director, Payments Council of India said while deal closures may not actually conclude, conversations were likely to take place. Last year, for instance, deals worth about $2-3 billion that concluded, had their origins in the event.
A high powered delegation from Saudi Arabia will also marking its presence, including Saudi Investment Authority and other institutions. They had approached the GFF convening committee and have stated their intent to meet up with pre-drawn list of 60 startups.
Other attendees include Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Deutsche Bundesbank of the Federal Republic of Germany, Banque de France, and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA.
With AI dominating corporate conversations it was felt that it should be the theme for the conference, but with financial inclusion at the core of it.
