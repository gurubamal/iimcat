Tech and electronics major Apple Inc. is set to launch its latest iPhone series 17 later today, along with a few accessories such as the AirPods Pro 3 and the Apple Watch Ultra 3.
However, there is another aspect looming. Notably, Apple's production line is largely based in China, and with Trump's tariff offensive, it leaned heavily on its India facilities to pick up demand. But that could change.
United States President Donald Trump is insistent that manufacturers start producing in the US, instead of China or India. For customers, especially, this could mean anything from a 40-50 per cent hike in cost to doubling and tripling of prices!
According to an AP report, both Trump and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have repeated what analysts feel is an “unrealistic demand.” Why? For one, it would take years to pull off, and even if achieved, the cost of a full US-made iPhone “would result in a doubling, or even a tripling, of the iPhone's current average price of about $1,000.”
In terms of pricing, the rumour mill is currently churning numbers closer to previous releases, with the base variant at $799 ( ₹79,900) and price hikes between $50-100 estimated for the Air, Pro, and Pro Max models, up to $1,249 (approximately ₹1,45,000).
But, tech analysts have warned that a “full” US-made iPhone could triple prices to $3,500 (around ₹3.1 lakh), CNN reported. Further, CNBC cited a Bank of America Securities official to note that the cost of labour difference between China and the US is dear — $40 ( ₹3,500) per unit in China vs $200 ( ₹17,219) per unit in the US — which could inflate the final cost of a US-made iPhone.
But, US manufacturing is still a long way away. The tariff impact on cost is still closer. According to a Reuters report, citing Rosenblatt Securities' estimates, if Apple chooses to pass down the tariffs to customers, the prices of all its models could jump by at least 43 per cent.
For the base model, that would be a jump from $799 to $1,142 (approximately ₹1,45,000), while the other models increase up to $2,300 (around ₹2 lakh) from $1,249.
Notably, at the recent launch of its new Pixel smartphone, Google did not increase prices. All eyes will thus be on the launch event today to see what route Apple takes.

Title   : GM Delays Cuts at Canada Plant Threatened by Trump’s Tariffs

General Motors Co. is pausing plans to eliminate a shift at its lone pickup-truck assembly plant in Canada, offering a temporary reprieve for hundreds of workers affected by President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
The Detroit-based automaker will keep three shifts at its factory in Oshawa, Ontario, until at least Jan. 30, according to Unifor, which represents workers at the plant that makes the Chevrolet Silverado.
In May, GM said it would cut one shift at the plant “in light of forecasted demand and the evolving trade environment,” and had planned to make the reduction this fall. The company has announced plans to boost Silverado output at a factory in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
The union also said Stellantis NV is bringing back a third shift at its factory in Windsor, Ontario, right across the border from Detroit, in the first quarter of 2026. Production was reduced at that plant, which makes Chrysler minivans and the Dodge Charger Daytona, shortly after Trump imposed tariffs on foreign-made automobiles.
Prime Minister Mark Carney retaliated by placing similar levies on US-made cars and light trucks — but soon after, his government said auto companies would be able to apply for tariff relief as long as they continued producing vehicles and investing in Canada.
Unifor has been pressuring Carney not to sign a trade deal with Trump that would enshrine tariffs on goods made in Canada.
“Auto workers still face a highly precarious situation in Oshawa as well as other auto communities, but it does show that the work our union is doing and the message our members are sending to decision-makers is making a difference,” Unifor National President Lana Payne said in a statement.

Title   : Trump floats new tariffs on China, India to squeeze Russia

US President Donald Trump told European officials he’s willing to impose sweeping new tariffs on India and China to push President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table with Ukraine — but only if EU nations do so as well.
Trump made the ask when he called into a meeting with senior US and EU officials in Washington, according to people familiar with the discussion, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. The US is willing to mirror tariffs imposed by Europe on either country, one of the people said.
The proposal amounted to a challenge given that several nations, including Hungary, have blocked more stringent EU sanctions targeting Russia’s energy sector in the past. Such measures would require the backing of all member states.
Other potential measures discussed by US and EU officials include further sanctions on Russia’s shadow fleet of oil tankers as well as restrictions on its banks, financial sector and major oil companies, according to the people.
Trump’s suggestion, first reported by the Financial Times, comes after his deadline for Putin to hold a bilateral meeting with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskiy passed without indication that the Russian leader, who met Trump late last month in Alaska, was genuinely interested in engaging in face-to-face peace talks.
Instead, Moscow has stepped up its Ukraine bombing campaign, with a strike Tuesday killing at least two dozen pensioners as they collected payments in eastern Ukraine.
Any US action would ultimately depend on Trump, who has so far refrained from punishing Russia directly despite skating through several self-imposed deadlines and Putin’s continued reluctance to negotiate an end to the war. Trump has, however, already doubled tariffs on India to 50% over its continued purchase of Russian oil.
Later Tuesday, Trump wrote a social media post that the US and India were continuing negotiations to address their trade barriers, and expressed optimism the two would reach an agreement to resolve their dispute. He also said he looked forward to “speaking with my good friend” Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the coming weeks.
Trump’s tariff proposal contrasts with a softer tone he has taken in recent months on China as part of apparent efforts to secure a summit with President Xi Jinping and a trade deal with the world’s second-largest economy. Last month, he extended a pause on higher tariffs on Chinese goods into early November, a move that stabilised trade ties.
Xi would likely retaliate against any escalation. Chinese exports have shown resilience despite a 55 per cent levy on shipments to the US, indicating Beijing has room to withstand more pain. For Trump, returning to tit-for-tat moves could destabilise China’s supply of rare earths that are critical to American manufacturing of everything from mobile phones to missiles.
Such a scenario would also jeopardise any meeting between Trump and China’s top leader that both nations are trying to arrange, and could take place as soon as next month on the sidelines of a major summit in South Korea.
China’s Foreign Ministry didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump’s latest tariff proposal.
The delegation of EU officials is visiting Washington this week to meet US counterparts and discuss the potential for joint action to pressure Russia to end its war against Ukraine and enter into negotiations with Kyiv.
Ukraine’s Prime Minister, Yuliya Svyrydenko, who also joined the discussions, said in a social media post that she urged Kyiv’s partners to target the shadow fleet, oil majors, refineries, traders, and other enablers.
The discussions come as the EU is discussing the content of a 19th package of sanctions, Bloomberg reported earlier.
Moscow is already under crippling sanctions from both the US and Europe, but has been able to skirt some of their impact by sourcing restricted items from China and other third countries, as well as finding customers for its oil and gas in Beijing, India and elsewhere.
But as the Russian economy shows increasing signs of strain, measures targeting those supplies and sources of vital revenue would likely dial up the pressure on Moscow’s war machine and finances.
