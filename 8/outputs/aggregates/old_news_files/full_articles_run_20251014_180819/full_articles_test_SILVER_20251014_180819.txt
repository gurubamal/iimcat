--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The white metal, which has delivered a scorching 70%-plus return this year and crossed the $50-an-ounce threshold for the first time ever last week, is now creating chaos in domestic markets as commodity traders acting as market makers report "low to negligible inventory" of London Bullion Market Association (LBMA)-certified silver bars—the only type regulators permit for ETF procurement.
Kotak, SBI, Tata, and UTI Mutual Fund have stopped accepting fresh lump-sum investments in their Silver ETFs as the supply crunch pushes domestic ETF prices far above international benchmarks, raising red flags about potential mark-to-market losses for investors once premiums normalise.
Bank of America has thrown fuel on the fire, raising its silver target to $65 an ounce with an average of $56.25, even as it anticipates an 11% decline in demand next year. The bank cited a continued supply shortfall, with the Silver Institute projecting the metal is on track to record its fifth consecutive year of structural market deficit.
"Silver jumped over 1.5% to above $53/oz on Tuesday, hitting fresh record highs as a historic short squeeze and tightening liquidity in London drove traders to scramble for physical supply globally," said Jigar Trivedi, Senior Research Analyst at Reliance Securities. "Lease rates in London soared more than 30% on Friday, pushing rollover costs for short positions to unsustainable levels."
Riya Singh, Research Analyst for Commodities and Currency at Emkay Global Financial Services, painted a stark picture of the global supply crisis: "Silver has surged sharply as investors rotate out of the dollar into tangible assets, reflecting mounting apprehension over U.S. fiscal stability and the autonomy of the Federal Reserve. Supply constraints have intensified, with robust shipments to the United States amid concerns of potential import tariffs draining London inventories to multi-year lows."
Singh highlighted India's pivotal role in the crisis, noting that the world's largest consumer of silver is seeing prices trade at steep premiums of 10-15% over global benchmarks. "In India, prices are trading at a steep premium driven by robust investment and festival-related demand, prompting physically backed ETFs to halt new subscriptions. Industrial and investment demand continues to outpace supply," she said.
Mirae Asset Mutual Fund issued a stark warning to investors about the dangers of buying at current elevated levels. "Due to the inventory shortage, the premium spiked in the domestic market, and higher demand made it worse. Market makers began quoting at higher levels both on screen (for ETF trading on the exchange) and off screen (for buying by ETF scheme), and investors continued to buy at elevated levels," the fund house said.

The distortion has upended normal market mechanics. While MCX futures typically serve as the primary reference price for physical silver in India, with bullion traders quoting premiums or discounts relative to it for LBMA-certified bars, current supply constraints have shattered this relationship. "The current supply constraints have distorted this relationship, leading to elevated acquisition costs as premiums have gone up multi-fold over regular premiums paid," Mirae Asset noted.
The fund house warned investors to exercise extreme caution: "High premiums will increase the cost of acquiring silver ETFs. If silver prices remain stable and premiums revert to normal levels in the near future, investors may face mark-to-market losses on their ETF holdings or losses corresponding to premium compression. We suggest that investors should avoid buying silver as of now and remain watchful for a few days."
The structural supply crisis runs deep. Singh explained that over the past four years, global silver consumption has exceeded production, eroding the surplus accumulated over the preceding five years. "In 2025, supply remains constrained, as roughly 70% of silver is mined as a by-product of other metals, limiting the pace at which output can respond to higher prices. Demand from renewable energy, electronics, and high-tech sectors further intensifies the structural deficit," she said.
India's import data underscores the severity of the imbalance. In the first eight months of 2025, silver imports plunged 42% to 3,302 tons, while ETF inflows and other investment channels surged. "Consequently, manufacturers are struggling to produce silverware, coins, and bars, while festive purchases ahead of Diwali have pushed premiums higher. Investor reluctance to liquidate existing holdings has tightened scrap availability, further straining the market," Singh added.
U.S. policy developments have added another layer of pressure. Following silver's inclusion in a draft critical minerals list in September, shipments to the United States have accelerated, raising concerns over potential tariffs under Section 232 investigations covering silver, platinum, and palladium. "This uncertainty, combined with historically low London inventories, has amplified price volatility. Benchmark London prices have approached record levels, nearing $53.95 per ounce," Singh said.

The supply squeeze has become so acute that traders are resorting to extraordinary measures. "Some traders transport silver bars via air freight, a method typically reserved for gold, to exploit the London premium. Silver's smaller market size and lower liquidity relative to gold magnify these price movements," Singh noted.
Singh projects silver could maintain its upward trajectory toward 165,000-185,000-194,639 levels domestically, while internationally it could test $56-$58-$59.89, with key support around 153,195-150,000 locally and $51.85-$50 globally. However, she cautioned: "Absent a stabilising central bank bid, even modest reductions in investment inflows could trigger sharp corrections, unwinding the London tightness that has underpinned the recent rally."
Meanwhile, personal finance author and 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' fame Robert Kiyosaki has been bullish on silver, calling it and cryptocurrency Ethereum "hot, hot, hot" in a recent social media post. Kiyosaki predicted that silver could soon hit $75 per ounce, after recently crossing the $50 mark.
Bank of America acknowledged the potential for near-term volatility, noting: "There is scope for recent dislocations to slowly start to normalise, which could then also increase volatility and put pressure on silver quotations near-term."
Trivedi added that markets remained focused on US-China trade dynamics ahead of a potential Trump-Xi meeting in South Korea later this month, while expectations for another Federal Reserve quarter-point rate cut this month, followed by a likely move in December, continued to support precious metals.

Title   : Silver soars to record high of $53/oz as supply shortage surges across the globe

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Silver is facing a supply shortage globally with a couple of government mints, such as the Canadian Royal Mint and Australia’s Perth Mint, stopping sales of products made with the white precious metal.
The development comes amid silver soaring to a record high of $53 an ounce early on Tuesday before easing towards $50.5 an ounce and then rebounding to $51.63 at 1945 hours IST. With a 75 per cent gain year-to-date, silver has outperformed gold in 2025. The yellow precious metal has gained about 55 per cent this year, with prices zooming to a record high of $4,140 an ounce on Tuesday before easing to $4,105.
In India, gold in the Mumbai spot market was quoted at ₹1,24,155 per 10 gm. Silver was quoted at ₹1,78,100 a kg. On MCX, silver December futures ended the first session at ₹1,56,707 a kg, while gold December contracts finished at ₹1,25,244 per 10 gm.
Soaring silver prices have resulted in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) charging premiums of about 10 per cent, leading to Kotak, SBI, UTI, ICICI and Tata Mutual Funds suspending subscription to their silver funds. The subscriptions will likely open only after the shortage eases.
Rates for borrowing
“Global silver supply has failed to keep pace with demand for seven consecutive years, leading to a structural market deficit, which is forecast to continue for a fifth consecutive year in 2025. This structural shortfall creates a unique floor for prices,” said Motilal Oswal Wealth Management (MOWM) in a note.
Geopolitical risk, persistent inflationary concerns and renewed investor interest, evidenced by significant inflows into exchange-traded products (ETFs) — reaching 95 million ounces in the first half of 2025 — have provided the speculative leverage required for sharp price increase, it said.
The supply squeeze in silver has led to the interest rate for borrowing the metal from banks to over 30 per cent (the metal will have to be replaced with a 30 per cent interest) in major centres such as London, Zurich and Singapore.
Data show that silver holdings in the London vault have dropped by over 30 per cent to 24,851 tonnes as of September 30, 2025, from 35,667 tonnes in April 2020.
Mints stop sales
MOWM said the drain was due to massive inflows into consumer markets such as India, while there has been a sustained demand for investment in bars and coins from the US and Germany. Market participants in China have withdrawn 480 tonnes of silver so far this year.
The Silver Academy reported that US mint production of one ounce Silver Eagles is only 20 per cent of last year’s output. This has resulted in premium for the coins and delays for delivery. “What was once the backbone of retail silver demand is now barely a trickle — demand overwhelming supply in a spectacular fashion,” it said.
The Royal Canadian Mint has stopped selling 10 and 100 ounces silver bars that meet demands from institutions. “Never before has the Canadian Mint failed to deliver these bars to market. Today, buyers get a simple answer: ‘none in stock and no timeline for resupply’,” the academy said.
Australia’s Perth Mint has suspended sales of all silver products. The UK’s Royal Mint has limited silver sales to one-ounce coins currently.
Why the shortage
Bloomberg reported that investment managers are saying that there is “no liquidity of silver available” for spot delivery at the London Bullion Market Association. MOWM said silver ETFs in India have outperformed so far in 2025, surging by about 70 per cent. This led to monthly silver ETFs investments increasing by 180 per cent in August.
Trade analysts say silver demand has exceeded 1.16 million ounces annually but supplies have been 800 million ounces short annually over the past five years.
The supply shortage is because 70 per cent of silver production is derived as a byproduct of metals such as copper and zinc, curbing the flexibility in production.
The current scenario in silver is not a repeat of what happened in 1980 or 2011. According to analysts, including from MOWM, silver is being re-priced as a critical industrial and monetary metal. They warn that the global market could witness one of the most critical supply crises now.
