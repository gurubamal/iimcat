Recognising young leaders and entrepreneurs, Hurun India recently released the latest “Under 35” list as a part of the Avendus Wealth – Hurun India Uth Series 2025. Although several of India’s top business leaders have built successful empires but some exercise more influence and social media dominance than others.
Neither Physics Wallah's Alakh Pandey, nor Meesho's Vidit Aatrey topped in terms of digital reach. The highest rank in “The Most Followed Minds of India’s U35 Club” was secured by 32-year-old billionaire Ritesh Agarwal of PRISM with 13.22 lakh LinkedIn followers. Occupying the second spot, Alakh Pandey boasts 4.65 lakh followers while Vidit Aatrey secured the third position with 3.01 followers.
The press release list states, “Other prominent names in the top 10 include Prabhkiran Singh (Bewakoof), Ajinkya Kulkarni (Wint Wealth), Shashank Kumar (Razorpay), Gaurav Khatri (Noise), Pawan Kumar Chandana (Skyroot Aerospace), Harshil Mathur (Razorpay) and Rahul Attuluri (NxtWave).”
The founder and CEO of hospitality chain named PRISM, Ritesh Agarwal's fame can be attributed to his appearance as a panellist on Shark Tank India Season 3 in 2024. According to the latest Hurun Rich List, Ritesh Agarwal's net worth in 2025 is estimated at ₹14,400 crore, marking a significant increase from last year's ₹1,900 crore.
Besides leading as social media icon, Ritesh emerged as India’s Young Disruptors, a pivotal figure in the “Next Wave of Innovation at 31” as per the Hurun India list. Carrying the next-generation baton in established enterprises, Ritesh secured 9th rank.
Celebrating the country’s young-seasoned entrepreneurs and next-generation leaders, Hurun India listed Ritesh Agarwal at 6th spot as one of the “Most Experienced U35 Leaders.” Another remarkable achievement of the company run by Odisha born businessman was that of securing second spot among the maximum number of “Funding Rounds Driven by U35 Startups.” Furthermore, PRISM dominates the U35-led startup landscape in terms of the “Most Funded U35 Startups.” Ritesh Agarwal's PRISM raised $3.7 bilion in equity funding in the year in consideration.
His LinkedIn profile description states, “With the early support of The Thiel Fellowship, I have been able to innovate and disrupt the hospitality industry. Seeking to bring budget accommodation for travellers that can be booked instantly, Ritesh boasts "skills in customer relationship management, strategic partnerships, and leadership, while expanding PRISM's presence across 35 countries.”

Infosys has announced that it has been awarded a £1.2 billion (approx. $1.6 billion) 15-year contract by the NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) to deliver the Future NHS Workforce Solution. This deal ranks among the largest announced by Infosys in recent times.
Siddharth Maurya, Founder and Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara Private Ltd , shared that winning a large deal indicates the company is experiencing an increase in client spending and demand for digital and AI transformation projects.
“This not only boosts the company’s total contract value, but is also a sign of the continued recovery trend in the Indian IT services market, which has been seeing a period of demand stagnation. It also provides evidence of Infosys’ strong business execution and ability to provide seamless, cost-efficient technology services to large global companies,” he said.
For the second quarter, Infosys is expected to outperform its counterparts, with a stable performance that can be attributed to deal ramp-ups and a gradual recovery in the discretionary IT spending in primary markets.
As part of this deal, Infosys will develop a data-driven workforce management solution that will replace the current Electronic Staff Record (ESR) system and continue to pay 1.9 million NHS employees in England and Wales over £55 billion in payroll annually.
The Future NHS Workforce Solution supports the NHS 10-year Health Plan and the mission to create a workforce that is fit for the future. This will be achieved through investment in infrastructure for the NHS workforce with a modern and future-proof solution, giving healthcare workers the tools they need to free up time to continue delivering patient care.
Advanced technologies
Powered by advanced technologies, the new solution will deliver a modern, flexible, and integrated platform that supports the entire employee lifecycle - from recruitment and onboarding to payroll, career development, and retirement. With intuitive, AI-driven tools, it will streamline workforce planning and enable data-driven decision-making, creating a seamless and user-friendly experience for the NHS staff.
Additionally, the solution will empower the NHS workforce to manage their personal information with ease, saving them valuable time. It will also enable seamless integration with other systems, improving the user experience and boosting operational efficiency.
Salil Parekh, CEO and MD, Infosys, said, “The NHS is a cornerstone of life in the UK, providing vital services that touch the lives of millions every day. With our extensive experience in delivering digital transformation and organizational change for global entities, combined with elements of our AI offering - Infosys Topaz, we will deliver a platform that not only drives efficiency today but empowers the NHS to elevate its invaluable work into the future.”
The company’s shares closed at ₹1,489.80 on the BSE, down by 0.21 per cent on Tuesday.
