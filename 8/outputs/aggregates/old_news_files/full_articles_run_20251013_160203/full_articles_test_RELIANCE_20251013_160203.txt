--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tata Mutual Fund has decided to temporarily suspend subscription to the units in Tata Silver ETF Fund of Fund (FoF) with effect from October 14, 2025, due to prevailing market conditions and shortage of physical silver in the domestic market.
However, all existing SIP (systematic investment plan) and STP (systematic trading plan) registered under the Tata Silver ETF FoF (scheme) will remain operational.
Moreover, during this suspension period, redemptions, switch-out, and Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) will continue to be permitted in accordance with the terms outlined in the Scheme Information Document.
Noting that silver is trading at a premium relative to international prices, Tata MF, in an addendum to the Tata Silver ETF FoF, said the premium in domestic silver prices directly impacts the valuation of the scheme.
“In light of the current market scenario, Tata Mutual Fund has decided to temporarily suspend all lump sum investments, switch-in into the scheme & fresh registration of SIP and STP into the scheme from the effective date....The aforesaid suspension is temporary in nature and shall continue only till further notice in this regard,” per the addendum.
The scheme is an open-ended FoF investing in Tata Silver Exchange Traded Fund (Tata Silver ETF). Tata Silver ETF is an open-ended scheme replicating/tracking Domestic Price of Silver.
