--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Religare Enterprises (REL) is planning to bring its unlisted insurance arm, Care Health Insurance, onto its books via a reverse merger through a preferential share issue, according to people familiar with the matter.
The proposal, approved by the board, would see REL issue shares to Care Health’s shareholders in exchange for their equity, effectively folding Care’s value into REL without the disclosure and regulatory burdens of a fresh initial public offering (IPO).
“REL is looking at a share-swap route rather than a direct listing. The board resolution has been passed and this scheme of allotment should take place soon, possible next quarter,” a person aware of the discussions said.
REL did not respond to a request for comments.
Care Health is broadly viewed as the primary value driver in REL’s business mix – with its notional market capitalisation expected to be over ₹15,000 crore. The valuation of REL is above ₹8,000 crore.
Another source said that “the aim is to benefit from Care’s valuation into REL with less public scrutiny. This would lead to REL getting swallowed due to Care’s valuation being higher than the parent company.”
A reverse merger refers to a corporate restructuring in which a private or unlisted company (Care Health) becomes part of a listed entity (REL) by merging into it, often by swapping shares, so the private company’s value is absorbed into the public company.
REL is in the process of applying to NCLT for an exception in this reverse merger to keep REL rather than Care Health.
Share swap
A preferential share issue will allow REL to issue fresh shares to the shareholders of Care Health at a negotiated price, without subjecting the arm to a separate public listing process – which entails extensive disclosures, market due diligence, underwriting, regulatory approvals and investor scrutiny.
This path is considered faster, less disruptive and gives the management more control over valuation terms. However, governance experts warn it can reduce transparency, limit price discovery and disadvantage minority shareholders if valuations or swap ratios are unfair.
Care Health, formerly Religare Health Insurance, has consistently been cited as a likely IPO candidate, but those plans have not moved forward amid leadership changes and pending regulatory matters. As per the latest shareholding pattern, Religare holds a 62 per cent stake in Care Health, while Kedaara Capital holds around 15 per cent stake.
Control battle
The parent company has been embroiled in a prolonged control tussle, as well as governance and regulatory scrutiny over past employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) issues.
In February, the Burman family of fast-moving consumer goods company Dabur formally took control of REL after a two-year battle with the management under the leadership of Rashmi Saluja. The promoters, however, managed to acquire up to 26 per cent stake of REL through an open offer, and oust Saluja from the board.
Since then, the Burmans have been pushing for structural and governance changes, and this proposed transaction could be a strategic lever in their agenda.
