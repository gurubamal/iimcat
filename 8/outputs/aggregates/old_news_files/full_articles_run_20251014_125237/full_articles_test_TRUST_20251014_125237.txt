Chennai-based Trusted Aerospace Engineering (TASE Global), a vendor to companies such as Boeing, Honeywell and Roche, is expanding its footprint in the US with the acquisition of Arizona-based Joined Alloys for ₹106 crore. TASE Global, which has a factory in Sriperumbudur, is also working on a brownfield expansion with an investment of nearly ₹150 crore.
Joined Alloys specialises in aerospace manufacturing, special processes and specialised sheet metal fabrication and product development, said Shankarraman Vaidyanathan, Chairman, TASE Global. Half the funding for the acquisition was through internal means and the rest is from line of credit, he added.
Currently, both TASE Global and Joined Alloys generate revenue of $32 million, which will increase to $45 million next year and to $100 million in three years.
TASE Global has facilities in Arizona and Chennai with total employees of around 400, equally distributed in both the places. In the last 45 years since it was started, the company has been delivering precision-machined assemblies to aviation, defence and medical sectors, he said. The company has set up offices in Toulouse, France, and Portugal to focus on the European market, he added.
Adding factories
Joined Alloy’s expertise is manufacturing complex aerospace components, sub-assemblies and assemblies, he told newspersons. It has served leading clients across regulated industries for over decades; major one being the US’ Department of Defence, he added.
Through the acquisition, two factories of Joined Alloys will be added to TASE Global, he said.
On the investment planned in India, currently, there are five premises and the plan is to bring all of them under a single roof, Rishi Vaidya, Director, CRM & PM, TASE Global, said. The aim is to invest additional capital in the next three years for large component manufacturing, aero-structure and additional capabilities in India, he added.
