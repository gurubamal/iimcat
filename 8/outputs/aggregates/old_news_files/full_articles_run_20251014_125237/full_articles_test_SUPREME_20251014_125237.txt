New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Centre and markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to respond to a plea by Sahara India Commercial Corporation Ltd (SICCL) seeking approval to sell 88 properties to Adani Properties Private Ltd to raise funds for repaying investors.
A special bench led by Chief Justice B.R. Gavai, comprising Justices Surya Kant and M.M. Sundresh, directed Sahara to implead the finance ministry and the corporate affairs ministry in the case.
The direction came after solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said the government must review Sahara’s proposal to sell these assets, including Aamby Valley in Maharashtra and Sahara Shaher in Lucknow, to the Adani Group.
“This appears to be a good suggestion, subject to various factors to be considered. The central government may also have to examine and present its views before the Court,” Mehta submitted, suggesting inclusion of the finance secretary and secretary, ministry of cooperation, noting that several cooperative societies had invested in Sahara entities through their members.
The court also asked amicus curiae senior advocate Shekhar Naphade to examine existing claims over the properties and prepare a detailed chart identifying assets that are disputed, free from claims, or have unclear ownership rights. It also ordered Sahara to review workers’ claims and coordinate with the Union government, Sebi, and the amicus before the next hearing.
The matter will be heard again on 17 November, when the court is expected to decide whether to grant approval for the proposed sale to Adani Properties.
During the hearing, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Adani Properties, said the company was willing to acquire all 88 properties in one go, even if some assets were subject to disputes, in order to avoid prolonged litigation.
The 88 properties listed in Sahara’s plea include Aamby Valley City (Maharashtra), Hotel Sahara Star (Mumbai), Sahara Shaher (Lucknow), Sahara Ganj (Lucknow), and several large tracts of land across multiple states.
Sahara has stated that proceeds from the sale will be deposited in the Sebi–Sahara Refund Account, as directed earlier by the Supreme Court, to repay investors of its optionally fully convertible debentures (OFCDs).
The proceedings form part of the long-running Sahara–Sebi dispute, in which the Supreme Court in 2012 directed Sahara entities to refund over ₹24,000 crore raised through OFCDs to investors via Sebi. Sahara was required to refund around ₹25,000 crore, along with 15% annual interest.
The group has claimed to have deposited around ₹16,000 crore till date, though Sebi maintains that over ₹9,000 crore remains outstanding.
As part of the disbursal process, the Court in September permitted the release of ₹5,000 crore from the refund account to depositors, including dues owed to investors of Sahara Group cooperative societies.
It is to be noted that Over the years, the Supreme Court has allowed Sahara and its group companies to sell properties to raise funds for investor repayments, provided the sale price is not less than 90% of market value.
In a similar move in September 2024, the court allowed Sahara to form a joint venture to develop its Versova property in Mumbai, with the aim of raising ₹10,000 crore, directing that all proceeds be deposited into the Sebi–Sahara Refund Account.
Real estate developer Oberoi Realty later expressed interest and deposited ₹1,000 crore with the Supreme Court. However, the funds were refunded after it was found that the Versova plot included alleged mangrove land, which could not be developed.
The court has since asked the Union Environment Ministry and Maharashtra Government to clarify whether the 106-acre Versova plot is fully or partially classified as mangrove forest. The matter remains pending.
Sahara Group’s legal troubles date back to 2010, when Sebi barred its chief, Subrata Roy, and its firms from raising funds through optionally fully convertible debentures (OFCDs), citing regulatory violations.
Sahara challenged the ruling in the Allahabad High Court, which temporarily restrained Sebi from taking action. However, the Delhi High Court later issued a warrant against Roy over allegations of investor fraud.
The Supreme Court ultimately ordered Sahara to disclose details of its OFCD schemes and refund investors with 15% interest.
In 2014, Subrata Roy was arrested for non-compliance and sent to Tihar Jail. He was released on parole in 2016 but continued to face legal scrutiny.
In November 2023, Roy passed away at a private hospital in Mumbai after a prolonged illness.

The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, sought responses from the Centre, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and other stakeholders on a plea filed by Sahara India Commercial Corporation Ltd (SICCL), seeking permission to sell 88 properties to Adani Properties Pvt Ltd.
A Special Bench of Chief Justice BR Gavai and Justices Surya Kant and MM Sundresh heard the plea, which is part of the long-pending matters concerning the Sahara Group’s refund obligations.
Acting on the submissions of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, the court directed that the Ministries of Finance and Cooperation be made parties to the proceedings and submit their responses by November 17. The Bench said the views of all parties with potential claims over the listed properties must be taken into account before any sale decision.
The matter will be heard next on November 17. Senior advocate and amicus curiae Shekhar Naphade was asked to compile details of the 88 properties proposed for sale, including whether they are free of disputes or contested by other parties. The Bench also asked the amicus to prepare a detailed chart showing properties where ownership rights are clear, under dispute or uncertain.
The court further directed Sahara to address pending salary claims of its workers, some of whom have reportedly not been paid for years. “We will decide whether the properties are to be sold piecemeal or together,” Chief Justice Gavai said.
Sahara had earlier sought the apex court’s approval to sell several of its prime assets, including the Aamby Valley project in Maharashtra and Sahara Shaher in Lucknow, to Adani Group.

Title   : Roche moves Supreme Court against Natco Pharma over sale of generic Risdiplam in India

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Delhi: Swiss drugmaker Roche has moved the Supreme Court, seeking to restrain Natco Pharma from selling the generic version of its life-saving spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) drug Risdiplam in India.
Roche approached the apex court after the Delhi High Court division bench on 9 October refused to bar Natco Pharma from selling the generic version, upholding a March single-judge order that had earlier denied Roche an injunction.
The plea for urgent listing was mentioned on Tuesday by Roche’s counsel before a bench led by Chief Justice B.R. Gavai, which agreed to hear the matter on Thursday or Friday.
Sold under the brand name Evrysdi, Risdiplam is used to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare genetic disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness and loss of motor function. Roche had sued Natco in early 2024 after learning of the Indian company’s plan to launch a lower-cost generic version.
In response to a query from Mint, a Roche spokesperson confirmed that the company had filed an appeal in the apex court, but declined to comment further.
Queries sent to Natco Pharma remained unanswered till press time.
The division bench’s 9 October ruling had cleared the way for a far cheaper version of the drug to enter the Indian market.
Following the decision, Natco Pharma announced the immediate launch of its product at a maximum retail price (MRP) of ₹15,900 for a 60 mg/80 ml bottle, a sharp drop from Roche’s price of over ₹6,00,000. The Hyderabad-based company also said it would offer additional discounts under its patient access programme
In a statement to Mint after the Delhi High Court’s decision, Roche said it was “disappointed” with the outcome and was evaluating its legal options, reaffirming its commitment to protecting pharmaceutical innovation within the framework of Indian law.
According to Roche, it has sought to address affordability concerns through patient access and compassionate-use programmes, under which 52 patients currently receive Risdiplam free of cost. Since its launch in 2021, about 300 patients in India have used Evrysdi.
While there are no official estimates of SMA cases in India, studies suggest the condition affects one in 7,744 live births and remains a leading genetic cause of infant mortality. According to an affidavit filed by the central government in the Kerala High Court earlier this year, the total annual cost of treating SMA patients in India could range between ₹6,400 crore and ₹34,000 crore.
Roche holds an Indian patent for Risdiplam, valid from May 2015 to May 2035. The company claims the molecule is a new chemical entity, distinct from earlier patents, and emphasizes the high cost of developing such treatments.
Natco Pharma, however, challenged Roche’s patent, alleging that the company was “evergreening” its monopoly by filing a narrowly defined patent with limited novelty. Natco argued that local manufacturing would drastically reduce costs, making the drug accessible to thousands of patients otherwise priced out of treatment.
The high court’s single-judge bench sided with Natco, holding that Roche’s earlier patent already covered similar compounds and that the company had not demonstrated a substantial technical advancement. The court cited public interest in ensuring affordable access to a life-saving medicine and took note of statements from SMA patients who said they were unable to afford the treatment.
The division bench later upheld that view, observing that public interest and access to affordable medicine can outweigh patent exclusivity in such cases.
The case has reignited debate over the balance between intellectual property rights and public health imperatives in India. Legal experts earlier told Mint that while India’s patent laws already provide for compulsory licensing in public health emergencies, bypassing those mechanisms and relying on broad judicial interpretations of “public interest” could create uncertainty for innovators.
Lawyers caution that while Natco’s ability to bring a generic version marks a significant win for Indian patients, it may also discourage global pharmaceutical companies from introducing or investing in new therapies in India, given the perceived unpredictability of patent enforcement.
