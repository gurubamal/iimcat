A spate of billion-dollar deals for Indian banks has thrust the country’s financial sector into the global spotlight, at a time when US credit losses and trade tensions have rattled investors globally.
Over the weekend, Emirates NBD Bank PJSC said it plans to invest $3 billion in RBL Bank Ltd., marking the biggest foreign investment in India’s banking sector. Earlier this month, Abu Dhabi’s International Holding Co. PJSC inked a deal to buy into Sammaan Capital Ltd. for about $1 billion, while Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc.’s banking unit in May agreed to pay $1.6 billion for 20 per cent of Yes Bank Ltd.
All told, about $15 billion of deals involving financial services targets in India have been struck this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show, as global investors scour for opportunities in one of the world’s fastest-growing major economies. This builds on the momentum of prior years to invest in lenders, insurance and fintech players.
The exuberance to what’s happening elsewhere is striking. Recent US collapses of Tricolor Holdings and First Brands Group have stoked fears of hidden credit losses. India itself is trying to work things out with the US after it was slapped with 50 per cent tariffs that could hit its growth.
There also isn’t a track record of triumph by overseas buyers, as the sector remains dominated by well-entrenched local players and had struggled with a shadow bank crisis less than a decade ago.
“The success story of foreign banks acquiring Indian banks is very limited” and hasn’t always reflected in profit and revenue growth, said Hemindra Hazari, an independent research analyst. The large sums foreign investors are willing to invest shows intent, but whether they can build a profitable retail franchise in India’s competitive market remains to be seen, he said.
For now, suitors are focusing on the positives. Indian lenders look relatively more insulated, and are gaining from rapid digital adoption, government moves, as well as a large under-banked population. Japan’s megabanks have been outspoken about their appetite for Indian assets, while deep-pocketed firms from the Middle East and Europe are now setting their sights on the expanding middle class in Asia’s third-largest economy.
“The Indian growth story has been accepted globally,” RBL’s Chief Executive Officer R Subramaniakumar said at a briefing on Sunday. He pointed out that a stable financial system and robust regulators add to the appeal.
A slate of decent earnings for the sector and the prospect of more deals have supported share prices recently. The Nifty Financial Services Index climbed to an intra-day record on Monday. Shares of RBL Bank rose as much as 8.4 per cent to the highest since February 2020.
The Reserve Bank of India has moved in recent years to strengthen the financial sector via measures aimed at boosting credit flow, encouraging lending and financing. The regulator has also clamped down on excessive risk-taking, frequently warning shadow lenders about pursuing growth at any cost and vowing to take action if they don’t strengthen risk controls.
The steps come after the sector blew up about seven years ago when a pile-up of bad loans weighed on growth. This led the government to overhaul bankruptcy laws and re-capitalize state-owned banks.
Now, policymakers are exploring ways to attract more foreign investment, including discussing options to make it easier for overseas investors to raise stakes in state-run banks and allowing large companies to apply for banking licenses, Bloomberg News reported earlier.
Recent set of earnings from industry heavyweights HDFC Bank Ltd. and ICICI Bank Ltd. saw both lenders reporting better-than-expected results driven by lending growth, even as interest margins remain under pressure. The 12-member Nifty Bank Index has rallied more than 13 per cent this year, closing at a record high on Friday.
More jumbo deals could follow. A planned government stake sale in IDBI Bank Ltd. is expected to fetch billions. Japan’s biggest lender Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. is actively hunting acquisition targets, and is said to be in advanced talks to buy a stake in Shriram Finance Ltd.
“Geopolitical risks have accelerated financial and supply chain risks, and foreign investors are looking for alphas in countries that minimize them,” said Vivek Ramji Iyer, partner and leader in financial services practices at Grant Thornton Bharat. “India’s domestic focus and low correlation with the global economy make it a lucrative entry point.”

Title   : Global companies hit by more than $35 billion in US tariffs, but outlook stabilises

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Global companies have flagged more than $35 billion in costs from US tariffs heading into third-quarter earnings, but many are lowering their initial forecasts as new trade deals reduce exposure to President Donald Trump’s levies.
Trump’s trade war has hiked US tariffs to their highest levels since the 1930s, and the president has regularly threatened more duties, but overall, the fog that paralysed many businesses is clearing, allowing executives to forecast costs and make plans — including some price hikes.
Companies expected a combined financial hit of $21.0 billion to $22.9 billion for 2025, with an impact of nearly $15 billion calculated for 2026, according to a Reuters analysis of hundreds of corporate statements, regulatory filings and earnings calls between July 16 and September 30. The total of more than $35 billion compares with $34 billion tallied in May, shortly after Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs in April rattled global supply chains. But the trajectory masks a shift: the increase is largely due to Toyota’s $9.5 billion estimate. Many other companies have lowered their earlier worst-case forecasts after Trump reached lower-rate trade deals with the EU and Japan. The figures combine annual and partial-year estimates from an overlapping group of firms. Both groups include about 60 firms. French spirits makers Remy Cointreau and Pernod Ricard both lowered estimates of tariff pain after the EU deal, while Sony in August cut its forecast. Trump also carved out exceptions, with only about a third of Brazil’s exports facing a 50% tariff, for instance. “Tariffs are getting clearer and clearer. And we believe that tariffs will be just another variable of our business equation that we need to be ready to manage, and we will,” Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa told Reuters in a mid-October interview, introducing new details of a $13 billion, four-year investment in U.S. manufacturing. Stellantis in July warned of a 1.5 billion-euro hit from U.S. tariffs this year.
“I think there is this sense that we reached a kind of landing point with some of the bilateral trade deals,” said International Chamber of Commerce Deputy Secretary General Andrew Wilson.
“But there will continue to be much greater complexity and this massive uncertainty.” Case in point: Trump earlier this month floated the idea of additional 100% tariffs on China. On Friday, he said the proposed tariffs would not be sustainable, and blamed Beijing for the latest tensions in trade talks between the two countries.
Consumer and manufacturing hit hardest
S&P 500 companies are projected to show an earnings growth rate of 9.3 per cent in the July-September period, a decline from 13.8 per cent in the second quarter, according to LSEG data. Much of that is on the back of the US. IT sector, driven by AI investment. Europe’s Stoxx 600 is expected to clock 0.5 per cent growth, down from 4 per cent in the previous quarter.
The pain is concentrated on companies that depend on countries that do not have trade deals. Nike, heavily dependent on suppliers in Vietnam and other Asian countries, raised its tariff impact estimate late last month to $1.5 billion from $1 billion. In Europe, Tefal kitchen-ware maker SEB recently cut its profit outlook, citing weaker demand as customers adopted a wait-and-see attitude partly due to tariffs, while H&M cautioned that U.S. tariffs on imports would weigh more heavily on margins in the quarter through November.
“We are cautious about the US heading into the fourth quarter, both connected to the impact of tariffs on the gross margin but equally also the consumer sentiment,” H&M CEO Daniel Erver told Reuters. “We can see the price increases.”
Price increases are the most frequent effect of tariffs cited by companies in the Reuters tracker. Carmakers including Ford, Stellantis, Volkswagen and Toyota collectively have reported billions in tariff-related costs. Ford, for instance, is expecting a cumulative $3 billion impact. Still, optimism has ticked up among automakers and auto parts suppliers as Trump has moved toward significant tariff relief for US auto production that could effectively eliminate many of the costs that have hit top car companies. Drug makers also have started rolling out deals on drug pricing and manufacturing that are tied to US tariff exemptions. Pfizer and AstraZeneca have led the way, and others are expected to follow.
