Apparel maker, Cantabil Retail India Ltd, which completes 25 years since inception, is eyeing revenues of over ₹1000 crore by FY27, with an aim to garner strong double-digit growth year-on-year backed by store footprint expansion. The company said it is witnessing good sales momentum during the ongoing festival season aided by GST rate cut and positive festival sentiment.
Effective September 22, GST rate on apparel products priced upto ₹2500 has been reduced to 5 per cent from 12 per cent. “Nearly 60 per cent of our revenue comes from the product portfolio in this price range. Our average selling price is to the tune of ₹1100-1200. We have passed on the benefits of the GST cut to consumers. Since September 22, we are seeing very good traction. So, overall Q2 has gone as per our expectations,” said Shivendra Nigam, CFO, Cantabil Retail India.
Consumption boost
“We expect the GST rate cut and income tax benefits among other factors to provide a strong consumption boost. We also expect this to strengthen the consumer shift from the unorganised segment to the organised segment in the apparel segment. We believe GST 2.0 will have a longer term positive impact on the sector,” he added.
The company said that it is eyeing over 20 per cent growth in the ongoing festival season and is witnessing buoyant consumer sentiment over the past days and expects this momentum to continue till Diwali.
The company ended FY25 with revenues of about ₹721 crore. “ We believe we have the potential to reach the ₹1000 crore milestone by FY 27. We are targeting strong double-digit growth of over 20 per cent to achieve this goal,” Nigam added.
As of September 30, the brand operates 632 stores, including franchise-owned stores. “ In the past six months, we have opened about 30 stores. About 30-40 stores are in pipeline. So we are on track to open to open 60-70 stores by the end of FY26,” he added. Nearly 6 per cent of the company’s sales currently comes from e-commerce channel. Nigam added that the brand is looking to steadly grow this share year-on-year and expects online channel’s share to grow to about 10 per cent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
India’s retail inflation cooled to 1.54 per cent in September from 2.07 per cent the previous month, marking the lowest reading in eight years since June 2017, mainly due to the statistical effect of a favourable base and driven by lower prices of vegetables.
“The decline in headline inflation and food inflation during the month of September 2025 is mainly attributed to favourable base effect and to decline in inflation of vegetables, oil and fats, fruits, pulses and products, cereal and products, egg, fuel and light, etc,” a statement by the Statistics Ministry said.
Meanwhile, core inflation (headline inflation minus food and fuel inflation) surged to a two-year high of 4.5 per cent in September after remaining stable at around 4.1 per cent over the past seven months.
“Record-high inflation in personal care and effects at 19.4 per cent (driven by gold), alongside housing inflation reaching over a two-year high at 4 per cent in September, were major contributors to the spike in core inflation,” said Paras Jasrai, Associate Director with Inda Ratings & Research.
Rate cut talks
However, experts do not find any merit in the rising chorus for another policy rate cut.
“Overall, the benign inflation and growth trajectory does provide room for 25-50 bps rate cuts. However, the festive-linked surge in retail sales may make it difficult to gauge the underlying sustainable demand in the economy and hence the timing of easing may become more difficult,” Upasna Bhardwaj, Chief Economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank, said.
In a note, HDFC Bank said since inflation is below the RBI’s target, there is space for another 25-50 bps of rate cuts. However, further rate cuts could be delivered only if growth momentum weakens significantly, and tariff risks continue to loom. “In our base case, we expect no further rate cuts from the RBI. However, if downside risk to growth emerges, we could see the policy rate inch towards 5 per cent by FY26,” it said.
