--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The initial public offering of Canara HSBC Life Insurance Company is drawing to a close today, but the subscription numbers remain tepid with just 31 per cent overall subscription so far.
The IPO received bids for 5.24 crore equity shares against 16.67 crore shares of offer.
Among categories, qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) have bid 0.33 times at 12.15 pm, non-institutional investors (NIIs) 0.20 times and retail investors 0.33 times, while the employee portion showed strength at 1.51 times subscription.
The ₹2,517-crore IPO, which opened on October 10 and concludes today, is entirely an offer for sale (OFS) of 23.75 crore equity shares and carries a price band of ₹100 to ₹106 per share. The minimum application lot is 140 shares.
Ahead of the IPO, the company mobilised little over ₹750 crore from anchor investors by allotting 7.08 crore shares to 33 funds, including ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund (MF), HDFC MF, DSP MF, WhiteOak Capital, Mirae Asset MF, Allianz Global Investors Fund and Amundi Funds.
Selling shareholders include Canara Bank, HSBC Insurance (Asia-Pacific) and Punjab National Bank.
Investor sentiment appears cautious. While analysts generally view the company’s fundamentals and promoter backing favourably, the weak demand at this stage signals investors are taking a wait-and-watch approach.
The allotment will happen on October 15, 2025, and the listing will likely happen on October 16.

Title   : India's growth cycle may be bottoming out, domestic fundamentals strong for pick-up in growth: HSBC MF

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
India's growth cycle may be bottoming out with strong domestic fundamentals supportive of a pick-up in growth going forward, according to a report by HSBC Mutual Fund. The report noted that interest rate and liquidity cycle, decline in crude prices, and a normal monsoon are all supportive factors for a revival in growth.
"We believe growth cycle in India may be bottoming out. Interest rate and liquidity cycle, decline in crude prices and normal monsoon are all supportive of a pick-up in growth going forward," the report said.
However, the report highlighted that global trade-related uncertainty remains a headwind to private capital expenditure in the near term. Despite this, the report expects India's investment cycle to be on a medium-term uptrend, supported by continued government investments in infrastructure and manufacturing, a pickup in private investments, and a recovery in the real estate cycle.
The report further stated that higher private investments in renewable energy and related supply chains, localization of higher-end technology components, and India becoming a more meaningful part of global supply chains will support faster growth in the coming years. On the market outlook, it noted that Nifty valuations are modestly above their 10-year average. It said that the outlook for Indian equities remains constructive, supported by a robust medium-term growth scenario.
The report also referred to the Reserve Bank of India's recent monetary policy decision, where the central bank raised its FY26 GDP growth forecast to 6.8 per cent year-on-year from 6.5 per cent previously. The RBI left key interest rates unchanged and maintained a neutral policy stance during its policy meeting on October 1, 2025. It, however, announced regulatory changes to support credit growth.
On the global front, the report said the macroeconomic environment remains challenging amid heightened geopolitical and economic uncertainties. It noted that reciprocal tariffs announced by the US administration are likely to impact both the US and global growth outlooks.
