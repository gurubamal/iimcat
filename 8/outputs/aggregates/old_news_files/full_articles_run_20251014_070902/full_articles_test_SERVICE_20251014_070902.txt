--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KFin Technologies has completed the acquisition of a 51 per cent controlling stake in Singapore-based Ascent Fund Services for $34.68 million, marking its entry into the global fund administration industry. The deal, announced today, positions KFintech as the sole promoter of Ascent, one of the fastest-growing fund administrators globally.
Ascent reported revenues of $17.5 million for the fiscal year ending July 2025, with assets under administration of $26 billion across 18 geographies, serving over 640 alternative investment funds. The acquisition increases KFintech’s global fund administration assets to approximately $340 billion as of September 2025, while raising the proportion of international business in overall revenue from 5 per cent to over 16 per cent.
The transaction brings over 250 domain experts into the KFintech group, which now operates from more than 230 offices across 15 countries, with over 6,700 employees. The remaining 49 per cent stake will be acquired in three equal tranches after fiscal years 2028, 2029, and 2030, subject to EBITDA milestones.
The investment has been funded entirely through internal accruals without impacting the company’s dividend policy or debt position. KFintech Managing Director Sreekanth Nadella said the combined entity targets international business revenues to exceed 25 per cent of the overall book in the near term. The integrated model will leverage India and Malaysia as centres of excellence for technology transformation and operational efficiency.
The shares of Kfin Technologies Ltd were trading at ₹1,115.60 down by ₹28.20 or 2.47 per cent on the NSE today at 12.45 pm.
