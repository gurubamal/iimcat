Speaking to ET Now, Sinha said while the buzz around Tata Motors’ restructuring and upcoming stock split has drawn investor attention, he prefers other plays in the auto space — particularly two-wheelers, EV makers, and tractor manufacturers, which are seeing stronger volume trends and better growth visibility.
Tata Motors: Not a preferred bet for now
Tata Motors shares slipped over 2% on Monday, emerging as the top Nifty loser, ahead of the special session scheduled between 9–10 am on Tuesday to determine the stock prices of Tata Motors and Tata Motors DVR post-demerger.However, Sinha remains cautious.
“Tata Motors has a global presence and, therefore, exposure to global risks. The company is also seeing some reduction in market share, particularly in the SUV segment,” he said.
The company’s global exposure through Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and domestic headwinds in the SUV category make it vulnerable to both macro and demand risks, he noted.
Auto sector outlook: Two-wheelers and tractors to lead
Despite weakness in Tata Motors, Sinha is bullish on the broader auto space, expecting an improvement in volumes across segments this quarter.“We have been overweight on autos for a while. There is an improvement in volumes, and we expect a positive surprise in the December quarter, particularly in two-wheelers,” Sinha said.
Two-wheelers back in the fast lane
Sinha highlighted that after several muted quarters, the two-wheeler segment is showing steady recovery driven by rural demand revival, lower base, and festive buying.“Two-wheelers such as Hero MotoCorp and TVS Motors are performing well. In the EV space, Ather Energy is gaining market share rapidly, while both Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto are strengthening their EV portfolios,” he noted.
Passenger vehicles (PVs): Value segment improving
In the passenger vehicle segment, Sinha expects Maruti Suzuki to benefit from its strong product lineup and value positioning.“There’s visible improvement in the value segment of passenger vehicles. Maruti remains a preferred pick,” he said.
Tractors: Strongest volume momentum
Among auto sub-sectors, tractors are showing the strongest volume growth, helped by a low base and recovery in rural income.“The tractor segment is on a good trajectory, and while full recovery hasn’t happened yet, we expect a positive surprise here as well,” Sinha said.
Festive outlook: Consumption to remain mixed
As the Diwali season approaches, markets are closely watching consumption trends across sectors. According to Sinha, the auto sector remains the strongest consumption theme, while FMCG and consumer durables may continue to see mixed trends due to weak on-ground demand and liquidity tightness.“People are closely watching how festive consumption pans out. The consumer goods space has been lacklustre — on-ground volume growth is not very strong,” he said.
“Working capital requirements and tight liquidity are impacting FMCG players. So, we are being selective.”
Among FMCG stocks, Sinha prefers companies with resilient brand portfolios and steady earnings visibility.
“Marico and Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL) are on our radar. These are the selective names we like within the consumption pack,” he added.
PSU banks and value plays may attract attention
While most attention is on consumption and auto, Sinha noted that PSU banks could see renewed interest given their attractive valuations and improved balance sheet strength.“People are looking at PSU banks at this juncture because valuations remain compelling. The larger private sector banks continue to trade at a premium, so value investors are likely to look at the PSU pack,” he explained.
However, Sinha remains selective in financials, preferring leverage plays within the auto and consumer durable space, where operating performance is improving.
Earnings season and management commentary key for markets
The near-term outlook for equities will hinge on corporate earnings and management commentary during the ongoing result season.“Overall, the result season will be critical. What managements say about demand trends, margins, and outlook for the rest of FY25 will determine the market’s tone,” Sinha said.
While the broader market has been volatile, select sectors like autos and defence continue to show relative strength, and Sinha expects stock-specific opportunities to emerge during earnings.
Positive bias on autos, selective on consumption
Summing up his strategy, Sinha said he expects the auto sector to lead the next leg of recovery, supported by festive demand, price stability, and margin improvement.“We remain positive on autos — especially two-wheelers, Maruti, and tractor players — as they show the strongest fundamental momentum,” he said.
“Consumption remains mixed, but selective FMCG names could deliver steady performance,” he said.
For investors looking to position ahead of Diwali, Sinha suggests sticking with growth-driven cyclicals such as autos and selective value plays in PSU banks and consumer durables, while staying cautious on global-exposed names like Tata Motors in the near term.
