RIL Segment-wise Performance

Grocery and Fashion delivered market leading performance growing 23% and 22% respectively. The consumer electronics division delivered 18% YoY growth aided by GST rate reduction and new launches.
The Oil to Chemicals (O2C) revenue increased by 3.2% YoY. Production meant for sale increased 2.3% on a YoY basis. Company’s fuel retailing operations through Jio-bp further expanded its domestic placement of transportation fuels. Jio-bp achieved a volume growth of 34% for HSD and 32% for MS.
Oil & Gas segment revenue decreased by 2.6% YoY mainly on account of natural decline of production in KGD6, and lower condensate price realisation. This was partly offset with improved KGD6 gas price realisation and higher volume of CBM.

The net sales were posted at Rs 19,371 crore in Q2FY26, versus Rs 15,967 crore in the same quarter last year.
UltraTech Cement reported a robust 22.3% growth in domestic grey cement sales during the September 2025 quarter, excluding contributions from its newly acquired India Cements and Kesoram assets, which were not part of the company in the year-ago period.
This performance far exceeded the industry average growth of around 5%, underscoring UltraTech’s strong market position and operational execution.
The company benefited from a 7% year-on-year decline in energy costs, though raw material expenses rose 5% due to higher prices of flyash and slag. For its existing operations, operating EBITDA per ton stood at Rs 966, based on a capacity of 166.76 mtpa.
The recently acquired assets of India Cements and Kesoram generated operating EBITDA of Rs 386 per ton and Rs 755 per ton, respectively. Integration progress has been swift, with 55% of Kesoram’s volumes and 31% of India Cements’ volumes already transitioned under the UltraTech brand.
