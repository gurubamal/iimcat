--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Packaged food company LT Foods, on Tuesday, said it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Hungary-based Global Green Europe Kft. for an enterprise value of about €25 million. It said this is in line with the long-term strategy to further strenthen its position in packaged food segment and enabling it to diversify into the high-value processed canned food segment. The company said the acquisition is synergistic to its existing business in Europe, while enabling it to make further inroads in Central and Southern Europe.
“The acquisition will be executed through LT Foods Europe Holdings, a wholly-owned step-down subsidiary of LT Foods. Under the agreement, LT Foods will pay €6 million at closing for 100 per cent equity shareholding, with the remaining €1.8 million payable over the next two years through earn-out mechanism besides taking over the borrowings,” the company said in a statement. The deal includes the acquisition of Global Green International (UK) and Greenhouse Agrár Kft., which serve as support and distribution entities. The deal is subject to FDI approval in Hungary.
V K Arora, Executive Chairman, LT Foods, said this acquisition marks an important step forward in expanding the company’s product portfolio and global footprint. “The acquisition of Global Green Europe Kft. enables us to enter the processed canned food market, leveraging synergies with our existing business in Europe. This acquisition also reinforces our commitment to building a globally-diversified food portfolio while maintaining leadership in rice-based products. We see this as an opportunity to further strengthen our relationship with customers and consumers by offering them a wider range of high-quality, ambient packaged food products.”
Consolidate position
The Hungarian operations of Global Green were established in 2006 following the acquisition of the erstwhile Intergarden N.V. and sells its products in 30 countries across Europe. It is key player in the production of Sweet Corn in Cans, and Gherkins, Silver Skin Onions, Peas and Sour Cherries in Jars. It has two manufacturing sites in Hungary. With an annual turnover of €40 million and a workforce of over 170 employees, Global Green Europe Kft. enables LT Foods to consolidate its strong position in the European market, the statement added. This category is estimated at €15 billion across Europe.
Vikas Magoon at LT Foods Europe said, “We already have a strong presence in Europe through our manufacturing operations in the Netherlands and the UK. Addition of Global Green Europe Kft., Hungary, will enable LT Foods to establish a third manufacturing hub in Europe, strengthening its foothold in Central and Southern Europe. A manufacturing base in Hungary also offers a relative cost advantage vis-à-vis our existing facilities, enhancing LT Foods’ competitiveness in the region.”
