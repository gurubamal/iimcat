As per disclosures, Adani Power has signed a 25-year Power Supply Agreement (PSA) with BSPGCL for supplying electricity from a proposed greenfield ultra supercritical thermal power plant.
The plant, coming up at Pirpainti in Bihar’s Bhagalpur district, will generate 2,400 MW through three units of 800 MW each. This project follows the earlier Letter of Award (LoA) issued in August 2025 by BSPGCL on behalf of the North Bihar Power Distribution Company Ltd. (NBPDCL) and South Bihar Power Distribution Company Ltd. (SBPDCL).
Adani Power secured the project by offering the lowest tariff of Rs 6.075 per unit (kWh). The total investment involved in constructing the plant and its associated infrastructure is expected to be around $3 billion, under the Design, Build, Finance, Own, and Operate (DBFOO) model.
The coal for the plant will be sourced under the SHAKTI Policy of the Government of India, which provides for coal linkage for power projects. In addition to addressing long-term power requirements in Bihar, the project is anticipated to create employment for 10,000–12,000 people during construction and about 3,000 jobs during operations.
