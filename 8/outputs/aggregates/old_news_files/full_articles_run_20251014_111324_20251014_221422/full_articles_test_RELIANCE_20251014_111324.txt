Title   : JPMorgan to Plow $1.5 Trillion Into US Security Industries

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JPMorgan Chase & Co. vowed to funnel $1.5 trillion into industries that bolster US economic security and resiliency over the next 10 years — an initiative that will invest billions of dollars in companies and hire bankers and other professionals.
The campaign will ramp up the amount of capital, resources and personnel that the largest US lender already dedicates to a variety of sectors, such as rare earth minerals, pharmaceutical precursors and robotics, or ventures developing defense, aerospace and energy technologies, such as drones, battery storage or grid resiliency.
JPMorgan estimated the effort will add as much as $500 billion to what it would’ve provided anyway.
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon is launching the initiative amid trade brinkmanship between Washington and Beijing. Last week, President Donald Trump vowed to impose a 100% tariff on goods from China after it announced stricter export controls of items that use even traces of certain rare earths, as well as equipment and technology for processing them.
“It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing – all of which are essential for our national security,” Dimon said in a statement Monday announcing the bank’s target. “We need to act now.”
Dimon, 69, has become more outspoken about US security in recent years. The country relies too much on potential adversaries for critical military products, he wrote in a letter to shareholders in May, citing China specifically. In 2023, he wrote that US supply chains for critical products and materials “must be domestic or only open to completely friendly allies or partners.”
Beyond loans and direct investments, there are a variety of ways big investment banks can provide funding to industries without opening their own wallets. That can include handling stock or bond sales, or arranging third-party financing. JPMorgan said the $1.5 trillion target will include funding that the firm facilitates. It noted the initiative will involve its asset and wealth management arm, which oversees client investments.
“This is not philanthropy. This is 100% commercial,” Dimon said Monday on a conference call to discuss the announcement. “We are going to take our resources of research, bankers and investors and we are going to scour the United States and maybe the world for new opportunities.”
Last year, companywide, JPMorgan extended credit and raised capital totaling $2.8 trillion.
Amid the new initiative, the bank will make equity and venture capital investments of as much as $10 billion to help certain companies expand, innovate or accelerate strategic manufacturing. The firm said it will also advocate policies supporting those efforts.
Dimon said Monday that JPMorgan will hire an investment team as well as dedicated bankers “who can deal not with just the best companies in the world but governments.”

Title   : BlackRock's assets hit record $13.46 trillion on third-quarter markets rally

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BlackRock on Tuesday reported a higher third-quarter profit as a rally in global markets lifted fee income and pushed its assets under management to a record $13.46 trillion.
Resilient consumer spending despite higher borrowing costs helped sustain the US economic momentum, fuelling gains in equity markets and prompting investors to pour money back into lower-cost index strategies.
A cooling labour market and moderating inflation pushed the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September - its first reduction this year - while expectations of further easing later in 2025 fuelled strong inflows into BlackRock's fixed-income exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
This inflow helped the firm offset softer performance fees and higher costs linked to the acquisition of alternative asset manager HPS Investment Partners.
BlackRock's assets under management rose to $13.46 trillion in the quarter, up from $11.48 trillion a year earlier. Long-term net inflows totalled about $171 billion, led by continued strength in its ETF business, which remains the firm's key driver of organic growth.
The world's largest asset manager reported adjusted earnings of $1.91 billion, or $11.55 per share, for the three months to September 30, up from $1.72 billion, or $11.46 per share, a year earlier.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
India’s mobile phone exports have registered a strong performance during the first half of this financial year (April-September), estimated to be $13.5 billion, marking a growth of over 60 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) as compared with $8.5 billion during the same period last year.
The United States (US), UAE, Austria, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom remained the top destinations for Indian mobile phone exports, said India Cellular & Electronics Association (ICEA) in its latest report.
The US is estimated to be accounting for nearly 70 per cent of total exports during April-September 2025, compared to 37 per cent during the same period last year, the industry body said.
Exports to the US have surged to estimated $9.4 billion in April-September from $3.1 billion in April-September 2024, a remarkable growth of almost 200 per cent, it said adding that this transformation underlines India’s growing role as a trusted source for global smartphone brands serving advanced markets.
Sustained rise
“The sustained rise in exports reflects the strong foundation of India’s mobile phone manufacturing ecosystem. Global value chains are now deeply anchoring here. The surge in exports to the advanced economies demonstrates global trust in India’s capability to deliver quality, scale, and reliability,” Pankaj Mohindroo, Chairman, ICEA, said.
ICEA estimates that mobile phone exports will reach around $35 billion in FY 2025-26, compared to $24.1 billion in FY 2024–25, he said adding that this growth consolidates India’s position among the world’s leading smartphone manufacturing and export destinations.
“India’s mobile phone industry is firing on all cylinders. The next phase of growth will depend on our ability to sustain the scale and competitiveness achieved so far. We must continue expanding this scale to a level that anchors sustainable exports and drives the deepening of the component and sub-assembly ecosystem within the country,” Mohindroo added.
On monthly basis, ICEA said that smartphone exports crossed an estimated $1.8 billion in September, reflecting a y-o-y growth of over 95 per cent compared to September 2024.
August and September are traditionally low-export months for the mobile phone industry due to production adjustments and seasonal shipment cycles. Despite this, exports in September remained exceptionally strong, demonstrating the robust ecosystem that has taken shape within the country, ICEA added.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reliance Power shares declined 0.93 per cent to ₹45.79 on Tuesday morning, down from the previous close of ₹46.22, following the arrest of its Chief Financial Officer and Executive Director Ashok Kumar Pal by the Enforcement Directorate.
Pal was arrested on October 10, 2025, under Section 19 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in connection with an alleged fake bank guarantee case. The ED had registered an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR/STF/14/2025) on June 16, 2025, based on an FIR filed by the Economic Offences Wing of Delhi Police on November 11, 2024.
In his resignation letter dated October 13, 2025, Pal stepped down from his positions effective October 11, 2025, citing the ongoing investigation. While maintaining his innocence, he stated he was tendering his resignation “considering my arrest and pending investigation in the interim till my name is cleared.”
The case involves an alleged fake endorsement of a bank guarantee against Earnest Money Deposit issued by a foreign bank, which was arranged by a third party. Reliance Power had filed the original complaint on October 16, 2024, asserting that the company and its subsidiaries “acted bonafidely and are a victim of fraud, forgery and cheating conspiracy.”
The company clarified that former chairman Anil D. Ambani has not been on the board for over 3.5 years and is not connected to this matter. The stock has traded between ₹31.27 and ₹76.49 over the past 52 weeks.

Title   : India's Russian oil imports in April-Sept fell 8.4% Y/Y, data shows

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
India's Russian oil imports between April and September fell 8.4% on year due to narrower discounts and tighter supplies, with refiners seeking more oil from the Middle East and the United States, according to trade sources and shipping data.
India is also under pressure from Washington, which has doubled tariffs on Indian goods, to reduce Russian oil imports. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro had said India's purchases of Russian crude were funding Moscow's war in Ukraine.
A refiner in India shipped in 1.75 million barrels per day of Russian oil in the first half of this fiscal year that began on April 1, shipping data obtained from trade sources show.
September's volume was flat versus August at 1.6 million bpd, down 14.2% from the same month a year ago, the data showed.
Reliance Industries Ltd and Nayara Energy boosted imports in September while state refiners' purchases fell.
U.S. trade negotiators have said curbing purchases of Russian oil is crucial to reducing India's tariff rate and sealing a trade deal.
Meanwhile, India's U.S. crude imports in April-September rose 6.8% on year to about 213,000 bpd.
India's higher purchase of US energy products is linked to the outcome of trade negotiations between the two countries, a government source said last week.
US.trade secretary Scott Bessent had said India would rebalance its crude purchases by buying more U.S. oil and less Russian oil.
Overall, India shipped in about 4.88 million bpd of oil in September, down by 1% from August, but up about 3.5% from the same month a year ago, the data showed.
During the April-September period, Russia's share in India's overall imports declined to about 36% from 40%, while that of the U.S. rose marginally.
The share of Middle Eastern oil in six months to September 2025 in overall imports rose to 45% from 42%, lifting the share of the OPEC nations to 49% from 45%, the data showed.
