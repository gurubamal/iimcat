Historically, Diwali and other auspicious periods have driven notable spikes in property bookings, with developers reporting a double digit increase in sales during these months.
Buyers often see the festival as an ideal time to invest, motivated not only by tradition but also by favorable financing, festive offers, and the psychological comfort of starting a new chapter in an auspicious period.
This year, developers are expecting the trend to continue, with strong demand across both premium metro projects and aspirational housing in Tier-2 cities.

Metro Markets and Premium Housing
Rishi Raj, CEO of Conscient Infrastructure, emphasizes the emotional and financial drivers behind festive homebuying. “The festive season has always held a special place in India’s homebuying sentiment — it’s when emotional aspirations and financial confidence intersect. Cultural beliefs around auspicious beginnings continue to guide decisions, even for younger buyers,” he said. At an industry level, bookings typically jump by 10–15% during this period, driven by both end-users and investors responding to market optimism, attractive financing options, and developer offerings.
Conscient Infrastructure’s premium launch last year, PARQ in Gurugram, saw a particularly positive response to its festive-themed offering. This year, the company expects similar traction with its upcoming Elaira Residences, built around its “Limitless” theme. Raj adds, “Festive home-buying sentiment will remain robust — where tradition and financial prudence go hand in hand.”
Tier-2 Cities Gain Momentum
The festive surge is not limited to metro areas. Rohit Kishore, CEO of Hero Realty, highlights the growing appetite in Tier-2 cities such as Mohali and Ludhiana.
“Auspicious days have always driven strong sales graphs, and the momentum never wanes. This festive season, markets like Dwarka Expressway are witnessing remarkable appreciation, reflecting both buyer interest and rapid infrastructure growth,” he said.
Kishore adds that recent policy measures, including the new GST implementation, are expected to stimulate consumption, streamline costs, and create a positive multiplier effect across the economy. Rising urbanization, growing aspirations, and enhanced lifestyle amenities are further encouraging buyers in Tier-2 cities to invest in quality housing.
A Positive Outlook
Developers agree that the current environment — marked by festive optimism,
favorable financing conditions, and improving infrastructure — creates the perfect backdrop for homebuyers and investors alike.
