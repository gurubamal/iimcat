--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Bloomberg) -- A spate of billion-dollar deals for Indian banks has thrust the country’s financial sector into the global spotlight, at a time when US credit losses and trade tensions have rattled investors globally.
Over the weekend, Emirates NBD Bank PJSC said it plans to invest $3 billion in RBL Bank Ltd., marking the biggest foreign investment in India’s banking sector. Earlier this month, Abu Dhabi’s International Holding Co. PJSC inked a deal to buy into Sammaan Capital Ltd. for about $1 billion, while Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc.’s banking unit in May agreed to pay $1.6 billion for 20% of Yes Bank Ltd.
All told, about $15 billion of deals involving financial services targets in India have been struck this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show, as global investors scour for opportunities in one of the world’s fastest-growing major economies. This builds on the momentum of prior years to invest in lenders, insurance and fintech players.
The exuberance to what’s happening elsewhere is striking. Recent US collapses of Tricolor Holdings and First Brands Group have stoked fears of hidden credit losses. India itself is trying to work things out with the US after it was slapped with 50% tariffs that could hit its growth.
There also isn’t a track record of triumph by overseas buyers, as the sector remains dominated by well-entrenched local players and had struggled with a shadow bank crisis less than a decade ago.
“The success story of foreign banks acquiring Indian banks is very limited” and hasn’t always reflected in profit and revenue growth, said Hemindra Hazari, an independent research analyst. The large sums foreign investors are willing to invest shows intent, but whether they can build a profitable retail franchise in India’s competitive market remains to be seen, he said.
For now, suitors are focusing on the positives. Indian lenders look relatively more insulated, and are gaining from rapid digital adoption, government moves, as well as a large under-banked population. Japan’s megabanks have been outspoken about their appetite for Indian assets, while deep-pocketed firms from the Middle East and Europe are now setting their sights on the expanding middle class in Asia’s third-largest economy.
“The Indian growth story has been accepted globally,” RBL’s Chief Executive Officer R Subramaniakumar said at a briefing on Sunday. He pointed out that a stable financial system and robust regulators add to the appeal.
The Reserve Bank of India has moved in recent years to strengthen the financial sector via measures aimed at boosting credit flow, encouraging lending and financing. The regulator has also clamped down on excessive risk-taking, frequently warning shadow lenders about pursuing growth at any cost and vowing to take action if they don’t strengthen risk controls.
The steps come after the sector blew up about seven years ago when a pile-up of bad loans weighed on growth. This led the government to overhaul bankruptcy laws and re-capitalize state-owned banks.
Now, policymakers are exploring ways to attract more foreign investment, including discussing options to make it easier for overseas investors to raise stakes in state-run banks and allowing large companies to apply for banking licenses, Bloomberg News reported earlier.
Recent set of earnings from industry heavyweights HDFC Bank Ltd. and ICICI Bank Ltd. saw both lenders reporting better-than-expected results driven by lending growth, even as interest margins remain under pressure. The 12-member Nifty Bank Index has rallied more than 13% this year, closing at a record high on Friday.
More jumbo deals could follow. A planned government stake sale in IDBI Bank Ltd. is expected to fetch billions. Japan’s biggest lender Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. is actively hunting acquisition targets, and is said to be in advanced talks to buy a stake in Shriram Finance Ltd.
“Geopolitical risks have accelerated financial and supply chain risks, and foreign investors are looking for alphas in countries that minimize them,” said Vivek Ramji Iyer, partner and leader in financial services practices at Grant Thornton Bharat. “India’s domestic focus and low correlation with the global economy make it a lucrative entry point.”

Title   : Billionaire bidders must show the money in Jaypee insolvency face-off

Billionaire bidders must show the money in Jaypee insolvency face-off
The bankrupt Jaiprakash Associates, once a prominent infrastructure and real estate developer, is estimated to owe ₹55,371 crore. The five bidders in the fray include billionaires Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Ltd, Gautam Adani's Adani Enterprises, and Naveen Jindal's Jindal Power Ltd.
New Delhi: The Committee of Creditors (CoC) of Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL) is set to review and seek details of how bidders, including Vedanta and Adani, intend to finance the acquisition of the debt-laden company. The resolution plans would be put to vote in November, two people aware of the development said.
This marks a key milestone in one of the longest-running corporate insolvency proceedings of the country.
The five bidders in fray are billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Ltd, billionaire Gautam Adani-led Adani Enterprises, billionaire Naveen Jindal-backed Jindal Power Ltd, Puneet Dalmia’s Dalmia Bharat and PNC Infratech Ltd.
“There are more processes to be followed and approvals to be taken before any acquisition is finalized," said the first of the two persons cited earlier, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The lenders are expected to seek proof of funds or a letter of comfort from the winning bidder, once the final resolution plan is approved by the CoC, this person told Mint.
A proof of funds is a documentation that verifies the liquid assets the acquirer has to complete a transaction or meet a financial obligation. On the other hand, a letter of comfort is a non-binding document from a third party, like a parent company or auditor, that provides assurance to a lender or investor about a borrower's ability to meet financial obligations
“For starters, if lenders are convinced about a particular resolution plan, they would seek proof of funding. If not, they could always consider the other proposals on the table," the person added.
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code of India provides for a committee of creditors—a body typically composed of banks, financial institutions, and bondholders that plays a pivotal role in the corporate insolvency resolution process.
Last week, the CoC of the Noida-headquartered company, the flagship of the Jaypee Group, sought submission of signed, non-conditional resolution plans from the five bidders. These will now be evaluated over the next two to four weeks, then put to vote.
One of the bidders said on the condition of anonymity that the plans are “signed or password-protected documents that outline (business) vertical-specific turnaround strategies." Each proposal, the person said, goes into detail on asset rationalisation, business restructuring, and potential synergy capture, including valuing them depending on business risks.
At one stage, as many as 26 potential bidders had expressed interest in acquiring Jaiprakash Associates’ assets. Since then, it was narrowed down to five.
Mint's queries to each of the five bidders remained unanswered till press time. Jaiprakash Associates’ resolution professional did not take calls or respond to an email.
Vedanta outbid the other four in the earlier stage, and the final evaluation will depend on a combination of financial and qualitative criteria. “The earlier bidding process was mainly to assess the commercial value of Jaiprakash’s diversified businesses," said the second person, adding that Vedanta has a “natural edge" now.
All five bidders have already received clearance from the Competition Commission of India (CCI) for their respective resolution plans, a prerequisite under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) before a final consideration by the CoC.
Heavy debt and asset spread
Jaiprakash Associates, once a prominent infrastructure and real estate developer, is estimated to owe ₹55,371.21 crore as of September-end 2025, according to its recent stock exchange filing. Most of this debt has already been transferred from a State Bank of India-led consortium to the National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd (NARCL), the government-backed bad bank set up to consolidate and resolve large stressed loans.
The company’s diversified portfolio spans infrastructure, cement, real estate, power, and hospitality. Its flagship real estate projects include Jaypee Greens and Wishtown in Noida, and the Jaypee Sports City near the upcoming Jewar airport.
In cement, the company operates plants in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh with a combined capacity of about 8 million tonnes per annum. It also holds a stake in Jaiprakash Power Ventures, which remains profitable.
However, several land parcels and real estate assets remain mired in litigation, posing potential challenges to asset monetization and valuation.
Advisors and process costs
In a separate stock market disclosure on Wednesday, Jaiprakash said that the CoC had approved the fees for Grant Thornton Bharat LLP, which has been appointed as consultant to determine the liquidation value for each financial creditor. The CoC has classified these fees as “insolvency resolution process costs" under the IBC framework.
Determining liquidation value is a mandatory step before lenders can vote on any resolution plan.
Long road to resolution
Jaiprakash had previously tried to sell the cement arm as a separate business unit to Dalmia Bharat, but the deal fell through as the former went into insolvency. At present, the resolution plans have to be made considering the company as a single business unit.
The acquisition offers both scale and strategic adjacency that include some having interest in power, some in cement and so on. Proximity of its land parcels to the upcoming Jewar airport was touted as major draw. However, the land remains under litigation.
