The company had earlier fixed August 14 as the record date to determine eligible shareholders for the payout. Shares of BEL rose 5% in today's trade following the announcement.
Shares of companies usually trade ex-dividend on the day or a day before the record date. When a company goes ex-dividend on a particular date, its stock does not carry the value of the next dividend payment. An ex-dividend date also dictates which shareholders are eligible to receive the dividend payment.
Headquartered in Bengaluru, BEL is a Navratna defence public sector undertaking under the Ministry of Defence. It is a key supplier of advanced electronics, radars, communication systems, and avionics to the Indian Armed Forces. Over the years, it has also diversified into civilian domains such as e-governance, homeland security, and renewable energy solutions.
Strong financial performance
The state-owned aerospace and defence electronics major reported revenue from operations of Rs 4,417 crore in the first quarter of FY26, a growth of 5% year-on-year (YoY) compared with Rs 4,199 crore in the same period last year.

Meanwhile, the profit after tax climbed 25% YoY to Rs 969 crore against Rs 776 crore in Q1FY25. The company’s order book stood at a robust Rs 74,859 crore as of June 2025, providing multi-year revenue visibility.
The company plays a crucial role in India’s indigenisation and self-reliance initiatives in defence manufacturing, supplying mission-critical equipment for platforms such as Akash missile systems, naval radars, and communication networks. Its collaboration with DRDO and other research agencies has helped in developing indigenous technologies to reduce dependence on imports.
With a growing defence budget and emphasis on “Make in India,” BEL remains a preferred play for investors seeking exposure to India’s aerospace and defence sector. Analysts note that the company’s steady dividend track record, healthy margins, and a sizable order book provide comfort despite volatility in the broader market.
