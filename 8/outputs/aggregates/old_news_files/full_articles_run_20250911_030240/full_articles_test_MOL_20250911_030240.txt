Tega Industries in consortium with funds managed by affiliates of Apollo, on Wednesday entered into a term sheet to acquire Molycop, a leading global supplier in grinding media for the mining industry, from an affiliate of American Industrial Partners (AIP) at an enterprise value of around $1.5 billion.
This strategic and complementary acquisition will establish Tega Industries as one of the world’s leading designers and manufacturers of ‘critical-to-operate’ consumables for certain production steps in the mining, mineral processing and material handling industries, with an innovative and differentiated product portfolio, according to a release.
The two entities, Tega Industries and Molycop, together delivered $1.73 billion (~INR 15,207 crore) in revenue and $217 million (~INR 1,906 crore) in EBITDA (as per latest available annual audited financial statements), reflecting consolidated performance prior to minority interest adjustments.
Mehul Mohanka, Managing Director and Group CEO of Tega Industries, said, “With this strategic acquisition, and in partnership with Apollo Funds, we will accelerate innovation, greatly expand market reach and create significant value for our customers.”
Gaurav Pant, Partner, Apollo, said, “This transaction will position the Molycop and Tega organisations to invest in additional technology and capabilities, and to continue their commitments to deliver reliable, high-quality products and solutions to industrial customers. For Apollo, this is a great example of pairing strategic equity and debt within a flexible, hybrid solution, and we look forward to partnering with the talented management team of Molycop and Tega to accelerate growth and drive value creation.”
Kim Marvin, General Partner, American Industrial Partners, said, “With its specialised expertise and talented team, Molycop is at the forefront of innovation. We’ve been proud to partner with them to advance their vision of becoming a leading supplier of consumable products to the mineral processing industry. We believe the business will be in excellent hands and well-positioned to continue creating value under Tega’s leadership.”
Jim Anderson, CEO of Molycop, said, “Joining forces with Tega and Apollo Funds will open up an exciting new chapter for Molycop. The synergy is clear to see. Our shared values and complementing strengths will help us accelerate our strategy, innovate better, and serve customers across the globe more effectively.”
Upon completion, Tega Industries will be the controlling shareholder of Molycop, with Apollo Funds owning a significant minority equity interest.
With complementary product baskets across the milling value chain between the two companies, Tega will be able to offer a comprehensive mill optimisation solution, to serve a larger share of its customer needs. Tega’s established presence in Europe, West Asia, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Latin America and Africa will be bolstered by Molycop’s activities in the US, Canada, Latin America and Australia, according to the release.
Completion of the transaction is subject to the execution of definitive transaction agreements and customary closing conditions, including the receipt of all required regulatory approvals. The parties currently expect the transaction to close by December 31, 2025, subject to receipt of the required regulatory approvals.
