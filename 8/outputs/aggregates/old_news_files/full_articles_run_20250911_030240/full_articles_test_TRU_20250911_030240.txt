--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The US judge who blocked the ouster of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook joined the growing chorus of her lower court colleagues to reject the idea that the Supreme Court’s recent actions bind her to side with the Trump administration.
US District Judge Jia Cobb in her decision Tuesday said she was “not persuaded” that the justices’ past orders allowing President Donald Trump to fire other officials bars her from keeping Cook in her job for now.
The Washington judge offered a case-by-case analysis for why Cook’s situation is different, including quoting the Supreme Court’s own language about how the Fed is “uniquely structured” from other independent federal agencies with members appointed by the president.
Tensions within the federal judiciary are mounting as the Supreme Court’s conservative majority routinely halts lower court rulings against the Trump administration on an emergency basis, often in orders featuring minimal or no explanation. A number of lower courts have rebuffed the Justice Department’s arguments in favor of reading, in the words of one judge, the justices’ “tea leaves.”
Cobb has made clear that she’s aware any ruling against the Trump administration is likely to be appealed and potentially reach the Supreme Court. During a recent hearing, she asked Cook’s attorney for examples of legal precedents that help her avoid being “smacked down” on appeal if she ruled on a core question about what qualifies as “for cause” for a president to remove an official.
The Justice Department filed papers to appeal midday Tuesday.
The escalating frustrations within the court system have at times spilled into public. In one recent exchange, Justice Neil Gorsuch chided lower courts not to “defy” the justices. A Massachusetts federal judge then wrote in a recent opinion that such criticism was “unhelpful and unnecessary” as she and her colleagues did their best to interpret and apply Supreme Court orders that are not “models of clarity.”
Cobb’s 49-page opinion in the Fed firing fight didn’t feature that type of pointed pushback. Still, she acknowledged the string of recent orders in Trump’s favor from the Supreme Court as well as the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, and then offered reasons for why each one doesn’t stop her from siding with Cook now.
Earlier this week, for instance, Chief Justice John Roberts issued an order that temporarily let Trump remove a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission who is suing over her firing. Cobb wrote that Roberts’ time-limited and “nonprecedential” order “provides no basis to doubt” the logic she cited from lower court judges in the FTC case for why a fired official faces “irreparable harm” if they can’t continue to serve amid an ongoing court fight.
Cobb, appointed to the federal bench by former President Joe Biden, addressed other recent agency firing cases in which the justices gave more weight to the harms that Trump faced in having officials exercising executive powers over his objection. The judge wrote that in one of those cases, the Supreme Court made a point of distinguishing the Fed as a “uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.”
“Cook is one of seven members of a board that is, by design, not intended to be susceptible to policy pressure, let alone tasked with implementing the president’s agenda,” she wrote.
The case is Cook v. Trump, 25-cv-2903, US District Court, District of Columbia .

Title   : From ‘dead economy’ to living towers — Trump rises in Pune

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pune
At Mundhwa chowk — rebranded as Koregaon Park Annexe, like a designer label stitched onto an old kurta — life still hums to the rhythm of pan stalls, welding sparks, garage hammers, and the steady rumble of water tankers.
Yet, towering over this everyday grind, a massive banner announces: “Trump — Coming Soon.”
Another proclaims with grandiosity: “Trump — The World’s Most Powerful Address.”
Inside a modest roadside shop, the local fabricator glances up at the billboard and chuckles: “So, this is the ‘dead economy’ Trump spoke of? Strange corpse — we’re still walking, sweating, welding.”
The Arrival
The Trump Organization formally entered India’s office property market in March this year, tying up with Tribeca Developers for a commercial project in Pune. The Trump World Center Pune promises two 27-storey office towers, expansive retail spaces, and a projected revenue of ₹2,500 crore on an investment of ₹1,700 crore.
The company has history here — it partnered with Panchshil Realty a few years ago to build a luxury residential project.
For locals, once dismissed as villagers on the city’s fringes, the shift feels like resurrection.
Land once undervalued is now coveted gold. Homes mocked as “too far” from the city suddenly sit at the heart of frenzied speculation.
Property rates have soared; even modest flats fetch no less than ₹1.5 crore.
The fabricator, who has spent three decades in Mundhwa, shrugs at the irony: “Big people say big things. One day India is dead, the next day they’re lining up to invest here.”
He also requested not to be named in the story, saying, “We are ordinary people; we prefer to focus on our work rather than get drawn into rhetoric.”
When the Dust Settles
Across the road from the Trump Tower construction site, tin sheds and scrappy shops hold their ground, their rusted shutters staring down convoys of trucks and tractors on the construction site. Steel and glass may rise into the sky, but corrugated iron refuses to flinch.
The garage worker, his face lit with a broad smile, watches the bustle and says: “Trump may tower, but we’re not small. We’ll still be here when the dust settles.”
His words, casually spoken, weigh more than the cement sacks being unloaded nearby.
The workers are equally animated about Trump’s latest remark on resuming negotiations over “trade barriers” with India. The garage hand, the fabricator and a chaiwala insist with quiet certainty: “This was bound to happen”. For them, the resilience of India’s economy is beyond doubt.
Return to Normal
Old Puneite C V Patwardhan delivers his judgment in a tone as sharp as a chili and twice as dry: “Where there is affluence and money, Trump will be there. India cannot be ignored. Just make sure this wealth is not swelling like a boil, but growth rooted in reality.”
The construction site is just a short walk from Pune’s Passport Office, where a bunch of agents observe that ever since Trump came to power, the number of students seeking US visas has declined.
Still, they believe this dip is temporary. India and Indians have played a crucial role in America’s development, and the flow will soon return to normal, they say unanimously.

Title   : India plans relief package for exporters hit by Trump’s Tariffs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
India’s cabinet will consider proposals for a broad support package for exporters hit by the US tariffs, people familiar with the matter said, as the South Asian nation braces for an uncertain future with its largest export destination.
The Ministry of Commerce and Industry has proposed measures to ease liquidity for exporters through collateral-free loans and subsidized interest rates, according to the people, who asked not to be identified as the information isn’t public. The cabinet may take up the plan at its meeting on Wednesday or in the coming days, the people said.
The relief measures are expected to be funded with the ₹2250 crores ($255 million) the government had set aside for export promotion in the federal budget in February, aimed at cushioning the impact of Trump’s tariff threats, they said. At the time, India-US ties were still warm and New Delhi expected to escape relatively unscathed. But relations have deteriorated sharply in recent months, with the White House imposing 50% tariffs in August to punish India for its trade barriers and oil purchases from Russia.
The tariffs are the highest in Asia, making Indian goods uncompetitive compared with manufacturing rivals like Vietnam and Bangladesh. The US is India’s biggest export market, and the levies are expected to hurt labor-intensive businesses like textiles and jewelry the most.
Still, signs of a possible thaw have emerged, with leaders from both nations pledging in recent hours to resume trade talks.
There have been discussions to increase the amount allocated in the federal budget, but talks are still at an early stage, the people said. The government aims to spend around 250 billion rupees over the next six years to support exporters, the Press Trust of India reported last month, citing an unnamed official.
India’s Ministry of Commerce and Industry did not respond to a request for comment.
According to Pankaj Chadha, chairman of the Engineering Export Promotion Council of India, exporters are facing a loss of about 30% in US-bound shipments because of the higher tariffs, and they want the government to shoulder at least half of the burden. Exporters will also lobby the central bank to allow them to temporarily convert proceeds from their US business at a rupee rate that’s 15% lower than current levels, Bloomberg reported earlier.
With the US market turning uncompetitive, the ministry is also mulling support for exporters diversifying into Africa and Latin America by providing help with branding, packaging, warehousing and export compliance, the people said.
