IDBI Bank has filed a fresh insolvency plea in the National Company Law Tribunal against Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (Zee), alleging a default of ₹225.2 crore, said an exchange filing by the media company. Terming the application “malicious, fraudulent and meritless and an abuse of the process of law”, Zee said it “vehemently” disputes the bank’s claims, and will take necessary and appropriate steps to contest it, including legal remedies for malicious prosecution, defamation and damages.
According to the filing, the bank was making the claim under a Debt Service Reserve Agreement for credit facilities availed by Siti Networks from the bank
The application is the latest in a series of complaints filed by IDBI against Zee. The first complaint was filed in 2022 and dismissed in 2023, following which an appeal was made by the bank, which was also dismissed in 2025. The bank had also made a claim against the same debt under the Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act, which was dismissed. A susequent appeal made in 2025 is pending adjudication and disposal before the Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunal, Delhi.
“Clearly, the present application is with mala fide intent to harass and cause disrepute to the company,” said Zee. Considering that the bank has not secured any favourable orders in its applications in the past and has also already lost in the earlier rounds before the NCLT, Zee said it does not expect any financial implication from the proceedings.
