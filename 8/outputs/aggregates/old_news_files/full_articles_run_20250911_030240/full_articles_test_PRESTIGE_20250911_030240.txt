Cookware and kitchen appliances brand TTK Prestige sees quick commerce as “hyper growth channel” for the company. Quick commerce contributes about 2 per cent to the company’s revenue, but is growing at around 50 per cent annually, said Venkatesh Vijayaraghavan, MD & CEO, TTK Prestige. The company reported a total income of ₹627 crore in the first quarter of FY25.
“Quick commerce is hyper-growth channel for us, and it continues to be an area we invest in. What is important for the category’s growth is that pricing doesn’t get disturbed, and so far, quick commerce players have been disciplined on that front,” Vijayaraghavan told businessline.
The company has around 15-20 per cent of its stock-keeping units (SKUs) listed on quick commerce platforms, and is expanding this in a calibrated manner. Appliances such as kettles and smaller cookware items have emerged as pseudo-impulse categories on these platforms, as consumers often buy them for last-minute needs.
Premiumisation
According to Vijayaraghavan, the rapid distribution expansion of quick commerce players in the top 50–60 towns, coupled with growing consumer comfort in purchasing appliances online, has been a “pleasant surprise” for the brand. On broader consumption trends, Vijayaraghavan noted that Tier-2 and Tier-3 markets are driving volume growth through greater penetration, while premiumisation is more evident in the top 500 urban towns, particularly in South India, where organised retail is stronger.
The company has also earmarked investments of about ₹200 crore over the next three years to expand capacities, strengthen R&D and build design and innovation capabilities. While quick commerce is consolidating its position in metros and top cities, e-commerce as a whole already accounts for about 17-18 per cent of the company’s sales, he said. Traditional general trade, by contrast, is growing at a modest 2-3 per cent.
