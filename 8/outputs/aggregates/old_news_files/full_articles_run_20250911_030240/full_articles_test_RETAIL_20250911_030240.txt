What brokerages say
AUM Capital: UCL’s ability to offer a wide range of home and beauty services like plumbing, electrical repairs, appliance servicing, painting, cleaning, hair care, and massage therapy makes it the first choice amongst potential and existing consumers. Of the major advantages of operating as a full-stack start-up, foremost is the capacity to grow in volumes as such a business is in control of its supply chain and customer experience, giving it an edge over its competitors.
UCL is stated to be India’s highest searched online home services full-stack platform brand on Google trends between January 2024 and March 2025. We would recommend a Subscribe to the issue.
Anand Rathi: We believe that the IPO is fully priced and recommend a “Subscribe- Long Term” rating to the IPO.
Hariprasad K, Founder – Livelong Wealth: Valuations demand scrutiny. The issue is priced at 12x sales and 61x earnings, placing it alongside global consumer-tech platforms, but at a premium to domestic peers. While the Grey Market Premium (GMP) hints at strong listing-day sentiment, the long-term thesis is more critical for investors.
High valuations leave little margin for error. Intense competition from offline service providers and quick-commerce platforms poses a threat. Execution challenges around quality, retention, and dispute resolution remain. Regulatory changes on gig-worker rights could also elevate compliance costs.
Gaurav Garg, Lemonn Markets Desk: For investors, this IPO is a high-risk, high-reward bet, suitable only for those with a long-term horizon, who believe in the company’s ability to scale sustainably as online penetration deepens. Our stance would be to ‘apply with caution,’ given the growth potential but stretched valuations.”
Urban Company offers a unique play on India’s rapidly formalising services economy, backed by strong network effects, hyperlocal execution, and technology-driven scalability. With a rising consumer base, professional upskilling ecosystem, and expanding product portfolio, the company is well-positioned to capture long-term growth in urban lifestyle services. At the given price band, the IPO provides investors exposure to a category leader with high brand recall, recurring demand visibility, and multiple monetisation levers — making it a compelling subscription opportunity for long-term investors. Owing to such developments, we recommend to subscribe.
