India Meteorological Department (IMD) has pushed expected timeline for intensification of a well-marked low-pressure area over south-east Arabian Sea and Lakshadweep area off Kerala-Karnataka coasts by another day. The system may move west-northwest to intensify as a depression by Monday.
It appeared to have lost momentum, when most wanted, as a twin circulation over south Andaman Sea and adjoining southeast Bay of Bengal got busy organising itself and began to divert easterly flows. Under its influence, a ‘low’ may form over south-east Bay of Bengal around by Tuesday.
Depression over Bay
It is likely to move west-northwest and intensify into a depression over south and adjoining west-central Bay by Thursday. Short to medium term projections from IMD indicate both systems will begin to develop intense traction sooner than later, and could likely become cyclones midweek.
Building churn in the Bay will have implications for not just the Andaman and Nicobar Islands but also further away for East Coast and adjoining Central India. Isolated heavy rainfall is forecast for the islands for next five days even as light to moderate rain and thunderstorms may hits its other parts.
East coast rain
Thunderstorms, lightning and gusty winds may hit Odisha for three days from Sunday; and with lightning over Madhya Pradesh and Vidarbha for as many days from Tuesday; over Chhattisgarh for five days from Monday; and Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura for five days from Sunday.
More rain for south
Also on Sunday, an existing third circulation located over Gulf of Munnar has moved westward over south Kerala and adjoining Comorin area. A rain-bearing trough linked the well-marked ‘low’ over south-east Arabian Sea and Lakshadweep area off Kerala-Karnataka coasts with south-west Bay across cyclonic circulation over south Kerala and adjoining Comorin area and Sri Lanka.
The IMD has forecast very heavy rainfall over Kerala and Mahe on Sunday and Monday, and later, for three days from Thursday; over Lakshadweep on Sunday; over Tamil Nadu and Rayalaseema for four days from Wednesday; South Interior Karnataka on Friday and Saturday; Coastal Andhra Pradesh and Yanam on Sunday, and for three days from Wednesday.
