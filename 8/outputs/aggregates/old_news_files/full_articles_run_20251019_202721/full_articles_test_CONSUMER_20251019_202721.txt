Consumer product makers across categories, including packaged food, durables, automobiles, ethnic apparel and gifting among others, are witnessing a robust uptick in sales during the Diwali festive weekend fuelled by buoyant buying sentiment.
Vikram Agarwal, MD, Greendot Health Foods, known for snacking brand Cornitos, said, “Based on what we are seeing in the market and from conversations with retailers, I think this year will be a bumper Diwali. GST rate cuts and attractive promotional offers across channels are fuelling this demand. We have also seen strong demand for gifting packs from both consumers and corporates with some stockists reporting stock out situation. We expect to end the festival season with 20-25 per cent growth.”
“We are seeing about 12-15 per cent growth due to strong consumption momentum driven by festive buying and GST rate cuts. On quick commerce channel alone, sales have been 30-40 per cent higher than non-festive period,” said Mayank Shah, Vice-President, Parle Products.
Festive drive
Automobile companies are also witnessing a sparkling Diwali season. Maruti Suzuki India said it expects to sell around 51,000 units this Dhanteras, the highest-ever sales on the auspicious day. Hyundai Motor India too said Dhanteras deliveries alone will be 20 per cent higher than last year.
Consumer durables firms and retailers are also witnessing a strong uptick in demand driven by premium products such as large screen LED TVs, front-load and top-load fully automatic washing machines and frost-free refrigerators. Companies such as Godrej Appliances and Haier India said that they are on track to garner high double-digit growth this festival season.
Praveen Khandelwal, Secretary General, the Confederation of All India Traders and Member of Parliament from Chandni Chowk, Delhi on Sunday stated that the industry body expects this year’s Diwali to generate sales exceeding ₹5 lakh crore. He added markets across the country are witnessing massive crowds this festive season.
Fashion rush
Ethnic apparel companies are also eyeing double-digit growth. Sidhant Keshwani, Founder and CEO, Libas said, “This Diwali is shaping up to be stronger than last year. GST 2.0 reforms have contributed to the momentum, and our curated collections and targeted campaigns are resonating well with the festive shoppers. We are seeing a 10 per cent year-on-year growth, reflecting strong engagement and interest from our customers.”
Siddharath Bindra, MD BIBA Fashion Ltd, said the brand is witnessing a “good double-digit growth over last year” driven by festive and occasion wear segments.
When it comes to gifting, consumers are preferring curated hampers and artisanal treats, said Avi Kumar, CMO, FNP. “Overall, this Diwali season has shaped up significantly better than last year, with a noticeable uptick in both demand and revenue,” Kumar added.
