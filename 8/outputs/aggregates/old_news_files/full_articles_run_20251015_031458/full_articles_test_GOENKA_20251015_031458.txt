The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) on Tuesday named Anant Goenka, Vice Chairman of the RPG Group, as its President-Elect for 2025-26 during FICCI National Executive Committee Meeting (NECM).
Goenka, currently FICCI’s Senior Vice President, will succeed Harsha Vardhan Agarwal as President of the apex business chamber at the conclusion of its 98th annual general meeting, scheduled for November 28-29 in New Delhi, FICCI said in a statement.
Goenka is Vice-Chairman of the $5-billion RPG Group, which has interests in tyre, infrastructure, pharmaceutical, IT and specialty sectors. He previously served as Chairman of the Automotive Tyre Manufacturers’ Association (ATMA).
From 2012 to 2023, Goenka was Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of CEAT Ltd, overseeing a decade of growth during which the company’s market capitalisation rose 25-fold. Under his leadership, CEAT received the World Economic Forum’s Lighthouse recognition and became the first tyre company globally to win the Deming Grand Prize in 2023.
Before joining CEAT, Goenka worked with Unilever and KEC International. He holds an MBA from the Kellogg School of Management and a bachelor’s degree in economics from the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.
He was awarded the Kabiller Science of Empathy Prize by Kellogg in 2023, named “Next Generation Business Leader of the Year” by Forbes in 2017, and featured in Economic Times–Spencer Stuart’s “40 under 40 Business Leaders.”
