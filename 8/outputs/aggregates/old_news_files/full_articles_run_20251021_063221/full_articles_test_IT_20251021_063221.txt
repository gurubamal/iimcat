--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Bloomberg) -- Stellantis NV Chief Executive Officer Antonio Filosa is meeting with Italian labor unions on Monday as weak demand prompts the maker of Fiat and Alfa Romeo cars to pause output at several factories.
Unions such as FIM-CISL and Fiom have said they want Filosa to clarify his intentions for manufacturing in Italy after a prolonged slump in local car production raises questions over the future of sites such as Cassino and Termoli. They also want more clarity on plans for the ailing Maserati brand.
Late last year, Stellantis pledged to make new models the overhauled Fiat 500 small car in Italy as part of a push to repair relations with government following the tenure of former CEO Carlos Tavares, who had pushed to move production to cheaper countries such as Morocco. A few days after his ouster, Stellantis pledged to invest €2 billion ($2.3 billion) in Italy this year.
Stellantis didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment to on the meeting.
Like its rivals, Stellantis is contending with excess capacity in Europe, where Chinese manufacturers led by BYD Co. are expanding with competitively priced cars. The company has committed to €6 billion in orders from local suppliers and vowed to shut down no Italian plants.
In Europe, Stellantis has temporarily shut down several sites because of lackluster demand for some models, with repercussions on local suppliers. Forvia on Monday said it’s facing costs of “several tens of millions of euros” in sales this year because of the production stoppage.
Filosa has scraped some European investments and vowed to invest $13 billion in the US, a critical market, over the next four years, further adding to European unions worries.

Title   : Diwali bang for D-Street, Nifty hits 52-week high as banks, IT stocks rally

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Nifty benchmark closed above 25,800, coming within 75 points of 26,000 during the day, and gaining about 4% in a year. The all-time high for the gauge is 26,277, recorded on September 27 last year. The Sensex climbed more than 400 points Monday.
The customary Diwali Muhurat trading on the bourses is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon.
The Nifty's advance was driven not by one or two pockets alone, but by a strong showing from public-sector banks and IT stocks, which led a market rally underpinned by positive sentiment domestically and decent global cues.
"As the festive spirit of Diwali fills the air with optimism and celebration, the Indian equity markets have mirrored the mood with a strong start to the week," said Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research & Derivatives at SBI Securities.
The BSE Sensex climbed 411.2 points, or 0.5%, to close at 84,363. The NSE Nifty-50 edged 133.3 points, or 0.5%, ending at 25,843. Intraday Nifty hit a 52-week high of 25,926.2.
Beyond the auto index that lagged, virtually all sectoral indices posted gains. In particular, the Nifty PSU Bank and Nifty Oil & Gas indices emerged as the top performers, indicating that institutional money is rotating into financials, especially state-run lenders.
The PSU Bank index surged nearly 3%, while the Nifty Oil & Gas and Nifty IT gauges advanced 1.4% and 1%, respectively.
The Volatility Index or VIX-the market's fear measure-plunged 2.32% to 11.36, in line with the rise in indices, indicating options traders see lower risks in the near term.
The broader market also went up marginally, with Nifty Midcap 150 jumping 0.6% and the Nifty Smallcap 250 gaining 0.5%.
Of the 4,464 stocks traded on the BSE, 2,447 advanced, while 1,835 declined.
"The market's strength was underpinned by upbeat quarterly results from heavyweights such as Reliance, HDFC Bank, and ICICI Bank, along with expectations of sustained foreign inflows amid improving global risk sentiment," said Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President-Research at Religare Broking.
However, Mishra advised caution given the quick pace of the recent rally.
"As the Nifty approaches the 26,000 mark, some consolidation cannot be ruled out before a fresh breakout; however, the overall bias remains positive, with immediate support around 25,650 and major support near 25,450," he said.
He recommended a "buy on dips" approach, focusing on large-cap and quality midcap stocks.
From a technical perspective, Nilesh Jain, Head of Technical & Derivatives Research at Centrum Broking, believes a brief pause in the uptrend may be possible. "At current levels, the risk-reward ratio appears unfavourable for fresh entries, hence buying on dips would be a prudent strategy."

Title   : Itch to bet: Cryptos crawl into real money games bypassing banks, leave no trail

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spurred by a penchant for betting, they are placing cryptocurrencies, instead of cash, with offshore bookmakers incorporated in Curacao, a South Caribbean island, to gamble in a slew of games - from poker and rummy to cricket and soccer. They think it could be a neat way to stay off the radar - sidestep the banking channels and leave no transaction trail.
Depositing cryptos is an option few tried in the past. But with a blanket ban on RMGs in India and banks keeping close vigil on new customers to shun mule accounts, Indian players with deep pockets and the wherewithal to source cryptos are trying it out. They are players in a niche market where the crypto deposits and the subsequent gaming wins in cryptos from RMG wagers double up as a bet on the digital coins as their prices surge.
"This is leading to the possibility of massive undetected money-laundering and tax evasion through such illegal betting platforms."
Overseas betting websites have started promoting their services more aggressively after the passage of the Promotion & Regulation of Online Gaming Act, 2025, and consequent stopping of services by most legitimate online RMG companies based in India, he said.
For these international gaming firms, Curacao, an autonomous constituent region within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, has been an obvious choice. A loose compliance regime till 2023 paved the way for several gaming startups and crypto casinos to set up base there as the island offered a "faster, cheaper, and more accessible licensing route".
While these overseas gaming companies may well be within the broad contours of their home country laws, Indian RMG players dealing with them are ending up treading a grey zone. Most of them procure cryptos like USDT (stablecoins linked to the US dollar) from the black market and then move the coins to the digital wallets of the foreign gaming companies to place their bets.
"Just as there is a hawala market for foreign exchange, there exists a black market for cryptos. Of course, it's not a mass market, but seasoned players know the agents who can source them cryptos at a slight premium for cash. Once the USDT is credited to their private wallets, they move the digital assets to another private wallet to make sure these are not 'flash USDT', which are fake coins that disappear after a day or two," said a senior official with one of the crypto exchanges.
For this bunch of RMG players, tapping the black market is necessary because there are hurdles in freely withdrawing virtual digital assets (VDAs) bought on Indian exchange platforms. Not only do most local platforms restrict easy withdrawals and transfers of cryptos to private wallets, but such transactions are reported to the Financial Intelligence Unit, a central anti-money laundering agency.
The offshore RMG outfits, however, are not bound by such regulations. "The digital currency," says the website of one such foreign platform, "stands out from other payment options as you don't have to worry about any third-party interference, thus making it one of the fastest and cost-efficient transactions available."
"Once your deposit is verified, your Bitcoin will be available on site to place bets. Another advantage of the digital currency is its added security and discretion with online transactions," it promises. The combination of public and private keys offers a greater level of security to the individual users, it adds.
Another foreign RMG company, peddling its crypto-deposit option, says that transactions in cryptocurrencies are "relevant for users who prefer digital currencies".
Faced with such loopholes and technologies to game the system, Sayta is of the view that the government should reconsider its decision to ban online money gaming, as it has failed to curb betting through illegal offshore websites, and instead look at a regulatory framework for skill-based real money games within the country that will allow such transactions to be tracked and taxed.
