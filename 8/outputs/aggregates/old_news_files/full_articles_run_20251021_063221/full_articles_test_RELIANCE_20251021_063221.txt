--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shares of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) on Monday ended nearly 4 per cent higher after the company reported a 9.6 per cent year-on-year rise in net profit for the September quarter, driven by a strong performance in its consumer-facing retail and telecom businesses and a recovery in the core oil-to-chemicals segment.
The bellwether stock edged higher by 3.52 per cent to settle at ₹1,466.80 on the BSE. During the day, it jumped 3.99 per cent to Rs 1,473.55.
At the NSE, the stock climbed 3.60 per cent to settle at Rs 1,467.90.
The company’s market valuation jumped by ₹67,459.38 crore to ₹19,84,943.09 crore.
The rally in Reliance shares also drove the equity markets higher. The 30-share BSE Sensex jumped 411.18 points or 0.49 per cent to settle at 84,363.37. The 50-share NSE Nifty surged 133.30 points or 0.52 per cent to 25,843.15.
The oil-to-retail conglomerate posted a consolidated net profit of ₹18,165 crore in July-September -- the second quarter of the 2025-26 fiscal year -- higher than ₹16,563 crore in the same period a year back, the company said in a statement on Friday.
Profit, however, sequentially fell 33 per cent when compared with ₹26,994 crore in the April-July quarter.
New customer addition and higher per user income, together with its wireless broadband services becoming the world’s largest, helped post a 13 per cent year-on-year jump in telecom earnings, and improving store operating matrix helped retail earnings soar 22 per cent. Improved refining margins and the highest-ever crude oil processing helped the O2C business.
Jio Platforms Ltd, the subsidiary that houses the telecom and digital businesses, saw profits rise by 13 per cent to ₹7,379 crore in the second quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Apple shares surged to an all-time high on Monday, with the iPhone maker close to becoming the third company to hit a $4 trillion market valuation as data showed strong momentum for the latest iPhone.
Data from research firm Counterpoint showed the iPhone 17 series outperformed its predecessor in early sales in China and the United States, with the newer models out-selling the iPhone 16 series by 14% during their first 10 days of availability in the two countries.
Apple shares jumped 4.5% to $263.7, giving it a market capitalization of about $3.91 trillion and making it the second most valuable company in the world behind AI-chip giant Nvidia.
Over the weekend, Evercore ISI added the stock to its Tactical Outperform List as the brokerage expects Apple to beat market expectations for the current three-month period and issue upbeat forecasts for the December quarter.
"The recent launch of online orders in China may be a positive tailwind for the Dec-qtr, as initial delivery time data reflects stronger initial demand relative to other regions at launch," Evercore ISI analysts wrote in a note.
Apple shares struggled earlier this year on concerns over tough competition in China and uncertainties around how the company would navigate high U.S. tariffs on Asian economies such as China and India, its major manufacturing hubs.
The stock is set for its biggest one-day jump since early August if gains hold and will be up 5% year-to-date.
Apple will report quarterly earnings after the bell on October 30.

With the beginning of a new Samvat 2082, brokerages InCred Equities and Religare Broking have identified 5 stocks each to buy this Diwali. While InCred has suggested techno-funda pick, Religare has recommended fundamental socks. The stocks are from varied sectors. Here is the list of 10 stocks with investment rationale and targets.
ETMarkets.com
2/11
Buy Apollo Tyres at Rs 460-500 | Upside: 20%
Target: Rs 580 Buy techno-funda pick Apollo Tyres with a 1-year view. A leading tire manufacturer, Apollo has a strong focus on replacement tires that comprise 65% of the India net sales. GST rate cut from 28% to 18% on tyres and from 12% to 5% on tractor tyres is expected to improve Apollo's competitiveness in India. Williams Alligator indicator is triggering a buy signal on monthly charts which augment the momentum in the coming months. (InCred Equities, Gaurav Bissa)
ETMarkets.com
3/11
Buy Canara Bank at Rs 120-130 | Upside: 25%
Target: Rs 156 Canara Bank is the 4th largest PSU bank in India with a nationwide network of over 17,600 branches and more than 12,000 ATMs, serving over 11.76 crore customers. All three Alligator lines are open and fanned upwards, indicative of an “eating” phase—signaling an established, strong trend. (InCred Equities, Gaurav Bissa)
ETMarkets.com
4/11
Buy NESCO at Rs 1320-1360 | Upside: 23%
Target: Rs 1,655 NESCO is a diversified Indian conglomerate with business interests spanning commercial real estate, exhibitions, events, hospitality, engineering, and catering. The Williams Alligator remains widely fanned and fully aligned upward, signaling a clear “eating phase”—confirmation of a prevailing strong trend at higher timeframes. (InCred Equities, Gaurav Bissa)
ETMarkets.com
5/11
Buy Sandur Manganese at Rs 205-225 | Upside: 30%
Target: Rs 280 Sandur Manganese & Iron Ores is one of India's oldest merchant miners, specializing in manganese and iron ore extraction and processing with over 70 years of operations. The company is pursuing new specialty steel applications including for railways, defense, exports, and EVs. MACD has flashed a fresh bullish crossover with both MACD and signal lines above zero, indicating renewed and strengthening upside momentum. (InCred Equities, Gaurav Bissa)
ETMarkets.com
6/11
Buy Premier Explosives at Rs 630-650 | Upside: 22%
Target: Rs 780 It is a leading Indian defense (contributing 86% of its revenues) and industrial explosives manufacturer with a diversified portfolio spanning solid propellants, warheads, ammunition, rocket motors, and commercial explosives. The company is actively participating in emergency defense procurements with Rs 700 crore of RFPs in the pipeline. All Williams Alligator lines are open and aligned upward, underscoring the “eating phase”. (InCred Equities, Gaurav Bissa)
ETMarkets.com
7/11
Buy RIL at Rs 1,375 | Upside: 16.4%
Target: Rs 1,600 Outlook remains robust, driven by sustained momentum in the high-growth consumer businesses (Jio and Retail) and the impending monetization of the New Energy giga complex. We expect this to translate into a strong consolidated Revenue/EBITDA to grow at a CAGR of 10%/15.1% over FY25–27E. The current valuation does not fully capture the immense value-unlocking potential from the New Energy and consolidated Media businesses. (Religare Broking)
ETMarkets.com
8/11
Buy HDFC Life Insurance at Rs 744 | Upside 17%
Target: Rs 870 HDFC Life’s consistent execution, strong brand franchise, and industry-leading profitability metrics justify its premium valuation. The long-term outlook remains robust, driven by its strategic expansion into underpenetrated Tier 2/3 markets, a growing protection business, and a relentless focus on digital innovation. (Religare Broking)
ANI
9/11
Buy Power Finance Corporation at Rs 397 | Upside: 27%
Target: Rs 502
PFC’s outlook remains strong, driven by its strategic role in financing India’s energy transition and infrastructure growth. The company is set to capitalize on a healthy disbursement pipeline, stableprofitability, and resilient asset quality, which are projected to deliver a PAT CAGR of 12.3% over FY25-27E. (Religare Broking)
ETMarkets.com
10/11
Buy M&M Financial Services at Rs 286 | Upside: 14.3%
Target: Rs 327 The long-term outlook for MMFS is positive, supported by its deep rural presence, strong promoter backing, and a clear strategy for portfolio diversification. With steady AUM growth, improving cost efficiencies, and stable asset quality, the company is well-positioned for healthy earnings momentum. (Religare Broking)
ETMarkets.com
11/11
Buy Nuvoco Vistas Corp at Rs 425 | Upside: 12.4%
Target: Rs 478 Nuvoco Vistas’ outlook is positive, underpinned by strong industry tailwinds and projected demand growth in the cement sector. The company’s strong operational performance, coupled with the strategic expansion through the Vadraj acquisition, provides clear visibility for future earnings. Management’s dual focus on deleveraging the core business while efficiently managing capex for growth inspires confidence.

Title   : Base-effect saves RIL Q2; a dilemma is now coming to the fore

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Base-effect saves RIL Q2; a dilemma is now coming to the fore
Reliance Industries' Q2 FY26 consolidated performance was heavily aided by a low base in O2C, retail and Jio Platforms.
Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) sailed through the September quarter (Q2FY26) buoyed by a favourable base in the oil to chemicals (O2C), retail and telecom (Jio Platforms Ltd) businesses. Among them, the performance of the O2C segment is critical for RIL’s outlook as the other two prepare for listing.
The O2C saw a multi-quarter low Ebitda in Q2FY25, both in absolute terms and per tonne of crude oil throughput (quantity of crude oil processed). This helped a year-on-year revival in Q2FY26. However, O2C saw 5% sequential decline in Ebitda/tonne of crude oil processed in Q2FY26. Crude oil throughput or volume was up 9% sequentially to 20.8 million tonnes, but it led to just 3% growth in absolute Ebitda as the higher procurement price of crude oil, including shipping costs, is likely to have impacted the per tonne margin adversely. Overall, RIL’s consolidated Ebitda rose 17.5% year-on-year to ₹45,885 crore.
With Q2FY26 earnings out of the way, investors may encounter a dilemma—which is the holding company discount. Jio Platforms’ listing is likely in the first half of 2026, which may be followed by Reliance Retail's listing. So, those looking to invest in these verticals may directly buy respective stocks instead of RIL shares. RIL holds a 66% stake in Jio Platforms, and it could fall to about 63% post listing, assuming minimum dilution of 2.5% as per the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi’s) revised norms for listing.
Investment conundrum
For perspective, Grasim Industries holds a 56% stake in UltraTech Cement, which would not be much different from RIL’s stake in Jio Platforms after listing. Brokerages such as Motilal Oswal Financial Services and ICICI Securities have applied a discount of 35-40% to the valuation of UltraTech while calculating the sum-of-the-parts (SoTP) for Grasim. Now, there is a possibility that RIL’s stake in Jio Platforms too could be valued after applying some holding company discount, as is being done for Grasim. There is an argument being made for no or lower holding company discount in view of Jio Platforms’ small public issue size after Sebi’s relaxation of norms. But it does not have any merit as there could be enough liquidity, as private equity investors who hold about 16% stake in Jio Platforms could consider selling post listing.
Meanwhile, Reliance Retail was undergoing restructuring of operations in Q2FY25, wherein it fine-tuned B2B operations and shut down unprofitable stores. Thus, leading to about 4% revenue decline in that quarter. In this backdrop, the 19% year-on-year rise in revenue to ₹79,128 crore in Q2FY26 appears to be impressive. Nevertheless, Reliance Retail is tackling competition by reaching 600 dark stores. Compared to Blinkit, which is closing in on 2,000 dark stores, this number may appear small. But Reliance Retail’s dark stores are complementary to its vast network of 20,000 stores spread across all cities, unlike the concentrated stores of quick commerce companies, mainly in big cities. This could give Reliance Retail an edge over other quick-commerce and E-commerce companies.
Further, Jio’s average revenue per user (Arpu), though up by just 1% sequentially, rose 8% year-on-year to ₹211 as the tariff hike in July 2024 began to gradually increase Arpu from Q2FY25 onward. The management has no intention of raising tariffs further any time soon. This could lead to slower Arpu growth in H2FY26 and consequently lower Ebitda. Meanwhile, in 2025 so far, the RIL stock is up 16% versus 8% returns by the benchmark index Nifty 50, Jio Platform’s IPO remains a key near-term event for the stock.
