1,KEC,KEC,62.0,neutral,MONITOR,"RSI deeply oversold at 22.75 indicating severe selling pressure with price at 20-day low (0% distance); Price 3.54% below 20-day SMA and 3.92% below 50-day SMA showing technical breakdown; Volume capitulation: 53% below average (197,816 vs 424,737) with negative 10-day momentum of -3.28%","RSI at 22.75 suggests potential oversold bounce opportunity - historically stocks recover from extreme RSI levels; Price only moderately below moving averages (<5%) - not severe breakdown territory yet; Monthly trend still up, suggesting longer-term structure intact despite short-term weakness",Weekly and daily trends both down creating bearish momentum alignment; Low volume on downtrend (46% of average) suggests weak support and potential for further decline; Price at 20-day low with no technical support visible - next support level uncertain,75.0,1,68.0,Technical-only assessment (no recent news),"KEC shows concerning technical deterioration with RSI at extreme oversold level of 22.75 and price breaking below both key moving averages. However, the moderate nature of the breakdown (under 4% below SMAs) combined with deeply oversold RSI suggests waiting for either a failed bounce or further breakdown before exiting. Set tight stop-loss and monitor closely over next 2-3 sessions."
2,DEEPAKNTR,DEEPAKNTR,62.0,neutral,MONITOR,"RSI deeply oversold at 25.34 with price at 20-day low (0% above low), indicating potential capitulation but breakdown risk remains; Price -2.56% below 20-day SMA and -3.37% below 50-day SMA with both weekly and monthly trends negative (confirmed downtrend); Negative 10-day momentum of -2.36% combined with elevated volume ratio of 1.67x suggests active selling pressure","RSI at 25.34 indicates extreme oversold conditions, historically suggesting potential near-term bounce rather than further collapse; Price breakdown from SMAs is moderate (-2.56%, -3.37%) not severe (>8%), suggesting support may hold near current levels; Bollinger Band position at -1.46 standard deviations shows price at lower band, often marking temporary bottoms in trending stocks","Multi-timeframe alignment bearish (daily, weekly, monthly all down) increases probability of extended downtrend if support breaks; High volume on decline (67% above average) indicates institutional participation in selling, not just retail capitulation; ATR at 1.45% shows moderate volatility, risk of further -3% to -5% move if current 20-day low support fails",75.0,1,58.0,Technical-only assessment (no recent news),"DEEPAKNTR shows concerning technical deterioration with price at 20-day lows, oversold RSI at 25.34, and bearish alignment across all timeframes. However, extreme oversold conditions and moderate (not severe) SMA breakdown suggest potential stabilization. Monitor closely for next 3-5 sessions: exit immediately if price breaks below ₹1,700 or RSI fails to recover above 30. Consider partial exit to reduce risk exposure."
3,PETRONET,PETRONET,22.0,neutral,HOLD,Below-average volume at 81.8% of 20-day average suggests weakening conviction; Weekly trend down conflicts with monthly trend up indicating short-term weakness; No significant news catalysts in recent window limits upside visibility,"Price 0.27% above 20-day SMA (₹280.49) and 1.35% above 50-day SMA (₹277.51) confirms intact uptrend support; RSI at 49.66 in neutral zone with room for upside, not overbought or broken down; Positive 10-day momentum of +2.05% with price near 20-day high (within 2.19%) shows recent strength",Declining volume trend (18.2% below average) could precede directional move if sellers emerge; Conflicting weekly vs monthly trend creates uncertainty in medium-term direction; Lack of fundamental news limits conviction for aggressive accumulation; Price consolidation near ₹281 requires catalyst to break higher or risks retracement to ₹275 support,78.0,1,15.0,Technical-only assessment (no recent news),"PETRONET shows no technical breakdown with price maintaining support above both key moving averages and neutral RSI at 49.66. The 2.05% positive momentum and stable Bollinger Band positioning indicate consolidation rather than distribution. However, declining volume and lack of catalysts warrant monitoring, with stop-loss at 5% to protect against support breaks."
